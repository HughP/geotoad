The Debian package of geotoad (up to 3.9.0) was maintained by Joey Hess
<joeyh@debian.org>. It was downloaded from http://geotoad.sourceforge.net/

The Debian package is currently orphaned, and has been dropped from official
Debian archives a couple of releases ago.
Upstream releases can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/geotoad/;
there is also a SVN at http://geotoad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
