Some hints for reporting bugs.




(The stable release of) GeoToad is supposed to work.
If it doesn't, there's a variety of possible reasons.
Please check the list below:

------------------------------------------------------------
Are you using the [CurrentDevelVersion development version]?
------------------------------------------------------------

 - If so, please do NOT submit an issue report.
 - Contact Steve8x8 at his GoogleMail account instead.
 - (See below for details which may help to isolate and reproduce the issue.)

---------------------------------------------------------
Have you upgraded to the [CurrentVersion latest release]?
---------------------------------------------------------

 - Check the [CurrentVersion] wiki page.
 - It may take a few days for it to notice, but GeoToad should tell you about available updates.
 - Note that "cross-grading" from development to stable versions cannot be done automatically!

-------------------------------------
There is nothing available for my OS.
-------------------------------------

 - Although Windows, Linux, and MacOSX are covered, we cannot build for each platform.
 - There are no plans yet to support individual OSes in terms of packaging. Feel free to suggest additions.
 - As a workaround, you may pick up the .tar.gz file - a working ruby installation is still necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I've got the latest version. It used to work, but now it's dead, Jim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are more or less frequent [GCmaintenances updates to the web site] it queries (which may cause certain patterns not to match any longer), and there are real bugs.

To make it work for you again, we therefore need some input to be able to identify the problem.

 - Always try to reproduce the problem, and allow us to reproduce it as well.
 - As much as possible, isolate the problem, rinse, repeat. Heisenbugs happen.
 - You're using the command line? Let us know. Using the TUI? It writes out a command line right before running the query.
 - Are you using a Ruby environment we haven't tested GeoToad against? 1.8.7, or 1.9.1/2/3 should be safe. 2.0 still has to grow.
 - Do you use a somewhat non-standard setup? We'd like to know your language settings, both in the OS and on the GC site.
 - Toggle _verbose output_ on (using "v" in the TUI, or "-v"/"--verbose" from the command line), and write the (copious!) output to a file.
 - Do NOT capture your screen on video!
 - The last few lines might already give you an idea what could have happened.
 - Check for the last occurrence of "wid = " in the debugging output. A few lines before, there should be a line "cachefile: ...".
 - Rename that file in your cache as it might be corrupted. Do _not remove_ it, we might need it later.
 - Rename the debug output file too, and run again.
 - If GeoToad repeatedly reports it cannot login, make a copy of the cookies.yaml file in the config folder, and remove the corresponding entry, then retry.
 - If GeoToad cannot access individual caches (e.g. error 500), try to run a "-q wid" query for them.
 - If the problem persists, we need the command line and the last output lines, starting with the "cachefile:" line, including the error thrown by Ruby.
 - Make sure you remove your credentials (password, perhaps username) and cookies from the command line and debug output.
 - If you are using _non-standard settings_ with gc.com's web pages (language, measurement units) that may also be important.
 - If the problem cannot be reproduced, the culprit seems to be the old cache file. Can you compare the two versions?

Before reporting an issue, please check with the [https://code.google.com/p/geotoad/source/list SVN browser] 
whether there might be a patch addressing your problem. 
Show-stopper fixes usually are committed directly to the trunk; 
development work takes also place in branches. 
Whether a commit went to trunk or branch can be seen by selecting it. 
You are welcome to review the changes, and leave your comments and suggestions

This seems to happen every now and then, unfortunately. You have no idea what people are putting into their cache descriptions, and log texts.
It's good practice to pass every GPX file through gpsbabel:

#!/bin/bash
# check a GPX file by passing through gpsbabel
for inputfile in "$@"
do
    echo -n "$inputfile: "
    gpsbabel -i gpx -o gpx -f "$inputfile" -F /dev/null >/tmp/$$.chk 2>&1
    ret=$?
    if [ $ret -eq 0 ]
    then
        echo " OK"
    else
        cat /tmp/$$.chk
        sed -ne "${line}p" "$inputfile"
    fi
    rm -f /tmp/$$.chk
done

This script (tested under Linux, to be invoked with a list of files) checks for the first error, and shows the corresponding line in the GPX file.
If you don't understand the output, just make sure it's contained in your bug report.
