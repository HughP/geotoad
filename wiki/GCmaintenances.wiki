#summary Collected gc.com maint dates, issues, and actions taken
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

I will try to collect announced gc.com maintenances (via their web page, or mailed), and resulting problems here.


= Details =

Site updates are usually scheduled on Tuesdays around noon Pacific local time.
There are exceptions to the rule.
Buggy updates get fixed without additional notice, by new server builds.
