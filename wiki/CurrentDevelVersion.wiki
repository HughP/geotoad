= Development will continue in the 3.17 series only! =
  * New features, after some time of testing, may be backported to the stable 3.16 series.

== Caveat emptor: ==
  * Development releases contain new additions to the code - which may not be thoroughly tested and result in malfunction.
  * To keep development going, I'd like you to try to break them and give feedback about any misbehaviour you may encounter.
  * Please report your observations to Steve8x8 at Google Mail *only*.
  * In your report, please include: command line, information about OS, locale/codepage settings, GC localization, Ruby and GeoToad versions.
  * See the ReportingBugs wiki page. The "verbose" option is the culprit.
  * Possible known issues below...:
  * New strategy of extracting owner and cache names (issue 245) may result in bad output data under Windows. Please e-mail "list" output.
