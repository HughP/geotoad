=="Proximity" search around an existing geocache==

There has been a request for "proximity" searches:
Sometimes, you plan to attend an event, or want to visit one of the
"geocaching legends" as "${my_country}'s First", and you don't want 
to miss the little traditional around the corner.

Here's a suggestion how to accomplish this (you will have to
add your credentials, and modify some other search parameters,
but you'll get the idea):

{{{
#!/bin/bash

CENTER=GC77       # or whatever should be the center of your search
DISTANCE=2km      # radius around $CENTER

# extract coordinates for $CENTER cache
geotoad -q wid -x list -o `pwd`/$CENTER.list $CENTER

# get coordinates from list
COORDS=`awk '{printf("%s,%s\n",$2,$3)}' $CENTER.list`

# now run the real query
geotoad -q coord -x gpx -o `pwd`/$CENTER-prox.gpx "$COORDS"
}}}
