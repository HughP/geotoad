.SH DESCRIPTION
Geotoad is software to help speed up the boring part of geocaching:
choosing the cache and collecting the data. GeoToad lets you perform
queries against the Geocaching website, and export the matching geocaches
to numerous devices and over 20 file formats.

If run without any parameters, geotoad will launch the interactive mode.
It can also be used in command-line mode for specific queries.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B  geotoad
invokes the text user interface
.TP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password 27513
Why do we need a username and password? In October of 2004, Geocaching.com
began to require a login in order to see the coordinates of a geocache.
Please note: Put quotes around your username if it has any spaces in it.
You've just made a file named geotoad-output.loc containing all the
geocaches nearby the zipcode 27513 suitable to be read by EasyGPS. Here are
some more complex examples that you can work with:
.TP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password "N56 44.392, E015 52.780"  -y 5
Search for caches within 5 miles of the above coordinates
.TP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password 27513:27502:33434
You can combine searches with the : delimiter. This works for all types,
though it's most often used with coordinate searches.
.TP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password -x text -o nc.txt -n -q state "North Carolina"
Outputs a text file with all of the caches in North Carolina that are
virgins (have never been found).
Please note the quotes around "North Carolina". Any parameters with spaces in
them must have quotes around them.
.TP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password -t 2.5 -x vcf -E "helixblue:Sallad" -o charlotte.vcf 28272
Gets every cache in the 100 mile radius of zipcode 28272, with a terrain
score of 2.5 or higher, and that helixblue and Sallad have not visited.
Outputs a VCF format file, which is usable by iPod's and other devices.
.TP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password -x html -b -K 'stream|creek|lake|river|ocean' -o watery.html -q state Indiana
Gets every cache in the state with travel bugs that matches those water keywords.
Makes a pretty HTML file out of it.
.TP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password -x gpx -o mylocal.gpx -z -y 1.75 -T 4 -q coord "N 51 23.456 E 012 34.567"
Create a GPX (1.0.1, with attributes) file with all caches around the location above,
max. 1.75 miles away, terrain value below or equal 4, include disabled ones.
