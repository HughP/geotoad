  -  GPS way off today, but we found it!
  -  Found at 3 30pm p Thanks for the cache p lrs&rms
  -  Nice camo job, but found quickly and was on my way.  TFTH!
  -  I made my mom get out and look for it in the rain, she didnt find it, so i tried a hunch and we spottted it while being eyed by someone taking a smoke break, so we had to be as discreet as we could be in replacing it. TFTC
  -  Found on a rainy day with Xile.

  -  Good hide! Great camo job!
  -  Very good camo job. The hardest part of this cache was navigating the traffic on this back side.
  -  Man that one was really camoed.  I had my hand practically on it and still didnt see it.  I went to the car and reread the clue and still almost didnt see it.  
  -  THANKS FOR THE HUNT br L SIG CARD

  -  Drove right to it. Strange how some days we go right to the cache site, then other days things seem to lock up and I couldnt find the cache if it had a sign over it shouting its location in neon lights. Oh well, thanks for the find.
  -  I parked by the name so I had to climb.  Nice easy find.  Thanks.

  -  Found right away.  Driven by here hundreds of time & never noticed this Cemetery.  I took $, left key chain flash light that is actually bigger than the cache.  Next finder will see what I mean.

  -  Didnt even know this litte historic cemetery exhisted. Awesome
  -  Found this one pretty easy,  couldnt figure out how to get it up, but got i anyways.  found with DJHobby.  Thanks!!
  -  Found it w/ no probs. once we got to the cemetery.  Drove right by the Cemetery though dont know how I missed it, you would think w/ a GPSr you could find something like that easy enough.  DO NOT,  I repeat DO NOT drive on down that lane unless you have a four wheel drive.   Luckly the skills I learned as a teenager of driving like the Duke Boys came in handy and I was able to keep my car that has 2 ground clearance from getting stuck.  But just barely.  
  -  Have seen this cemetary along the road for some years, but never considered it for a cache.  Thank You
  -  Weve had some bad luck with M&M containers,ether we never find it or it takes us a long time to. I hope this one has changed our luck with em. br Thanks  br Jim, Di And The Boyz br Bruceville, Indiana
  -  Thanks for the cache, good hide.Log was in good shape.
  -  I happened to glance at my GPS just in time to make the turn.  I didnt even know that Cemetery was there.  Easy find.  Signed the log.  The cache is in good condition.  Thanks for the fun! br Strohem
  -  Perfect cache for a cold winter day.  I wish I hadnt given the clue to the kids.  It was too easy after that. p Thanks, The 5Gregorys 
  -  Our first cache find of 2005!  Thanks!  TNLNSL.
  -  found 12 12 04 8 00am. this one actually made it a week without a FTF,so I reckon the honor goes to me.nice,out of the way place.TN,left one of my cards.thanx.Doc

  -  Nice park. Were just getting in a little Geocaching while in town visiting our son. Took radio left calculator. Thanks for the hide.
  -  Loved the park. Found before a baseball game. Had nothing to trade so TNLNSL
  -  Went alone on this hunt  Found it on lunch break.  What a beautiful day!  Cache looks to be in good shape.  Took nothing, left poem. SL.  TFTH.  Gus
  -  Found this one with friends while recovering from a Wolfpack loss.
  -  Found this one on a cloudy afternoon with friends.
  -  Our first find in NC and we were here with newbies  unofficially  Geodog and Geocat.  Nice cache!!  Left a spider, spider geobutton, power ranger, and butterfly stickers.  Took video, car, and a frog.  Traded TBs   took Jump, the Frog and left Nazar   necklace from Germany .  TFTC!!!!  spider99
  -  Made the trip to Cary this morning hoping to get the WJTB.  I should have read all the logs.  It seems that someone got it but didnt log the TB. p Anyway . . . Nice park, nice walk, nice day  inspite of Ophelia , and a nice hide!  TNLNSL.  TFTH!
  -  Took Scooby Doo book, dropped off Jump, the Scholarly Frog travel bug after taking him to visit NCSU.  SL.  TFTH.
  -  Second of the day with the my girls.  Find was made more difficult because it was just getting dark.
  -  great hide.  We always enjoy a walk in this park.  The weather was beautiful today.  We took the JEEP travel bug.
  -  Stopped by today to check on the cache and everything was in order. br Also dropped of Bardan the White Jeep Travel Bug.
  -  If youre hunting in the summer, watch for spiders, take a stick to get them out of the way. 
  -  Yep, theres spiders all right.  Cary a loooonnnng stick, and wave it about in front of you.  TNLNSL.
  -  Quick find after some nearby letterboxing.  Much better than the last time i came here.  Thanks Kiwis for ressurecting this cache.  Didnt have my daughter this time, so i just signed the log.  Nice container.  I wish i could find some in that good of shape.
  -  Also experienced the spider webs in the face walk.  TFTH, TNLN.
  -  Nice walk in the park though near the cache I ran through a spider web between every  seems like  tree. TFTH.
  -  Great cache with some interesting stuff inside. We took a star ball and left a toy car.
  -  It was fun to find this cache. We were visiting the area from Southern California. On advice from a local cacher, we took a walk around this lake. We saw people fishing. Some of them had several fish. What was most interesting was that some of these fishermen werent using rod or reel   instead they had fishing line wrapped around bottles. They were casting by throwing the weight and float into the lake while holding part of the bottle. p The cache is in great shape and full of goodies but we still TNLNSL. p Thanks, p Team Geo Jedi
  -  Visited the cache today with friends. We replaced the tupperware container with a large, dark green ammocan. Its above ground, nestled against the side of a large fallen tree, under a few small sticks. Its full of all sorts of nice things, a new log book, and should be a reletively easy find. The photos given on the cache page are no longer accurate. We are in the process of adopting responsibility for this cache. 
  -  Found w/ Reward.  Also ran across a cache apparantly from a party a couple months ago, still there...
  -  I didnt trip over this one like gitana did, but found it. Note that it has moved and is not where it is pictured on the cache page.  Actually, I like the hide location a lot and would recommend it stay where it is! 
  -  We looked around for awhile but we didnt find this one. Pretty sure we had the right tree, but we didnt see it. We will come back and try this one again another day.
  -  Out with USMC2052 today for a stroll in the park, TFTHSL
  -  found it with jgh team . t  mcD. teddy bear. l  sugar bear
  -  We had fun with this one. Found it by using the ole foot dragging method. Thanks! 
  -  Same problem here.  Found three possible trees and nothing.  I also saw the surveyors stake so maybe the owner needs to check on this one.  I found the Chevy Cache and Googalooga after the other cachers so this one may be missing.
  -  We also looked around the area.  Didnt dig anywhere, since its one of the rules of this site that you shouldnt have to.  We did see where someone else had poked all around the bases of the two trees in the area.  After looking at the picture, im not 100% certain that we looked at the right tree, but there were three in the area of the coordinates and we looked at all three.  One of them had an orienteering stake near the base.  I dont know if thats recent, but im guessing it does mean additional non geocaching traffic through the area.
  -  We found three downed trees within the errors of the instruments but none had a cache near their bases.  Maybe Well try again sometime.  Im sure we were close as we found the stuff in the clues but no cache.  Of course, it could have been buried deeper than we dug; either way, we didnt find it!     
  -  Found this while in the park for a picnic with the family while we were in town from Webster NY.  Thanks for taking me around the park on a fine day.
  -  Caching with friends in North Carolina.  The youngest, newest cacher found this one all by herself! Took the bouncy ball and trash bag and left a key chain. TFTC. br HappyTrackers
  -  Does anybody know what the holes near this cache are caused by?
  -  Although this cache appears to have been moved from its original hiding spot  based on the hint and pictures  it was still a great find!  We walked by it several times before I literally stumbled upon it.     p We left a small rubber stamp and took the flip flop travel bug hoping to help it on its journey. p Thanks for the hide!  And good luck with school!
  -  first of three today with Handy Find!
  -  Found with Feather today, TNLNSL.
  -  Well, we finally found it... I dont think it is in its original hiding spot   the place we found it doesnt look anything like the pictures!  However, it is pretty close! br TFTH!
  -  Took a co worker out on a first geocaching expedition on a beautiful day.  This was our first of three in Bond Park.  We must have been trailing behind Tom and Family, cause they beat us to all three today. br Left Monsters Inc straw and GC button.  Took frog. br Thanks for reintroducing us to a nice park. br Oh yeah...and this brought us to the big 25 in finds!!   br 
  -  My Family and I found this one 2nd of three in the park we searched for today. This was a beutiful park. We took a dog license tag and a spiderman doll, and left a teletubbie clip on doll and and a playschool guitar. We almost gave up on this one until it jumped up and almost bit me. TFTH SL
  -  It was an overcast day and a bit chilly, but a nice day for geocaching. Not many muggles in the park and we saw only on lonesome cold grasshopper looking for something green to munch on. ;   The cache wasnt quite next to the uprooted trees as stated by the note about the cache. Not sure if it had been moved by somebody since we did find a suspicious hole next to the roots that would have been ideal for the cache to be. Anyway, thank for the hide! We left a Sonic electronic game and took a golf ball wax candle.
  -  Sounds like our method of discovery was quite like most of the others...  If you cant find it by traditional methods, maybe youll kick it or step on it or ... SOMETHING! p If Ida really realized how CLOSE this was to the other cache here I wouldnt have bothered to get in the car and drive to it... p Um... I quickl realized my mistake, turned the car back around and just to make it LOOK like I wasnt that stupid, parked the car in a different spot.... in the same lot, of course. p Sheesh.
  -  Just happened to have the coordinates in the gps, but did not have the clues.  Took a little bit of searching since the batteries were low, but we got it.  TNLN. TFTH! p nc_geocacher & Leslie
  -  Quick find. Soggy, full logbook. Nice location. TNLN. 
  -  Quick find after work today. Log book still full and still damp. Took nothing, left a pink pencil and small sheet of paper  from another cache!  to use as a continuation for the log    and signed it, of course... thanx
  -  As mentioned in other logs, the logbook is full and slightly damp. p Found this one with the good old use your foot as a broom until you kick the cache technique    .  Rather lucky, I guess, as my GPSr was pointing me about 40 feet away from the cache. p  MarkRebuck,   a href http //www.markrebuck.com/ target _blank visit link /a   
  -  Found this one and log was damp..  great find completed my bond park run.
  -  Found this one fairly easily.  Log Book is full and slightly damp.  After getting back and looking at the pictures I have come to the conclusion that the cache has been moved, glad I didnt look at the pictures before I searched for it or I would have thought it was missing. br TNLN  SL
  -  The last find of the hike at Bond Park. The drizzle was getting a bit heavier and the sun had set. I went straight from Googalooga. I found the orienteering marker that I knew was nearby. The cache wasnt in the exact spot I had marked on my map, but it only took a couple minutes to work the grid and find it. TFTC.
  -  Not sure why this cache is marked unavailable. We walked right up on it with no problems. The cache and log book are a little damp but still there...and the log book is full. Took rubber ball and left a paratrooper toy, signed log. TFTC
  -  My son and I walked all around the downed trees.  Nothing.  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_sad.gif border 0 align middle 
  -  We found the large fallen tree off the trail between the two signs. Our GPS receiver indicated two feet. Six people went through & under all the leaves & debris within a 40 ft radius. The cache wasnt there.
  -  Beautiful day in the park, short easy bushwhack.  Took coin and a pencil.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  Pretty quick find and pretty quick visit   heard many muggle voices nearby  although I dont think they were as close as I thought . TNLNSL  Thanks!
  -  This was our first find.  Was very popular today.  We came upon it as another group was putting it back. 
  -  Had to look for wuite a while, but finally our dog helped us out. Thanks.
  -  This was not easy to find.  After 15 minutes my eagle eyed son found it.  Hint  Now it is not right next to the root ball but near.  We had fun though. p  This entry was edited by philliph2 on Sunday, November 28, 2004 at 5 50 01 PM. 
  -  Second of my familys three finds in Bond Park today. Took us just a couple of minutes to locate. br Took  A bottle of bubble mixture.  Left  A gold coloured Air Force coin. br Thanks for the hunt.
  -  The family went out and found this one together.  We had to search a little bit because the GPS put us 30 feet or so away, but we found it in about 30 minutes.  Took a Mount Rushmore Keychain, left a Clifford rubber bouncy ball.  Thanks!
  -  2nd find in Bond Park.  On vacation from South Dakota and decided to do some caching in North Carolina.  Found it with my 10 year old nephew and he enjoyed looking for the caches.  Took Batman and left a South Dakota pencil and Mt. Rushmore key chain. Thanks for the great cache. It was fun trying to find it.
  -  Found after a pretty good search.  Log is soaked.  Thanks for the cache.
  -  Good hide... Things HAVE changed since this one was placed.  The hint pics are no longer the same as the original container... I dont think.. I took 4 nickles and left 2 geobuttons.  TFTH
  -  A nice evening in the park. Thanks!
  -  Nice hide!  I found this while in the park w/ my little brothers cub scout group setting off rockets.  I was able to find this and 2 others while I was here.  TNLN
  -  LOL, guess the Magellan slingshot led us right past the correct spot, which had us looking in the wrong places at first. OOPS! Eventually we made our way back to the hint and found it right away! LOL Thanks for the fun!
  -  A quick find in a nice section of park.
  -  Took my 3 youngest for a hike through the park.  We all had a great time   took 3 small toys, left 3.  Thanks for the hunt and treasure.
  -  Found it after a nice walk around the lake with the family. Took silly putty, left snowman pencil. Busy day at Bond Park. 
  -  Did this after Good Googalooga!, and this was a quick jog from that cache. Took a little while to find, but it was easy once I saw its spot. TNLN, my 2nd of 8 finds Saturday.
  -  I was looking in the wrong tree, as I was looking in the largest downed tree   .  Thanks for the hide!!!
  -  Going caching with a 2 and 7 year old makes for quite a celebration when opening these caches. br Left a blank CD, Took nothing.
  -  Lots of people fishing around the lake today. The log book is pretty full, I was lucky to find one blank page left ^_^  Took nothing left some Silly Putty. p I took some pictures if you would like to see them  br URL for the pictures    a href http //www.pbase.com/piggyson/geocache/ target _blank visit link /a     Caution Spoliers  p Thanks for the Cache.
  -  4 in one park cool! br out  mctoy and tiger br in  Madonna CD and Transormer br in/out Blueberry TB br Thanks for the smiley! br Rixart Huluvu,Emilymaus br 
  -  After locating GC242 I noticed this one was only 409 feet away.  Without the sheet of hints  Left in the car at the community center , my etrex Venture put us right on top of it. Took crayons, left batman and ShirKahn  Taken from GC242  That tells you that a 4 year old only has an attention span of 400 feet when it comes to geocache treasures.
  -  Found this in a Bond Park sweep. Took either an gator or a croc  I couldnt tell he had his mouth closed  Left a Pedro keychain.
  -  Found it in good condition.  Our 2 yo enjoyed her first cache although she didnt get the take something part.  TNLN
  -  Was in the area for many of the other caches in Bond Park... couldnt locate this one. Hmmmmm...
  -  Thanks for an easy one, it was loaded with stuff but the log was damp . . . we just had a heavy rain? THANKS br Granpa Alex
  -  Our last find of the day, the sweat was starting to build up in the afternoon heat, although this was nice and shady, could have used a breeze!  Also got to this one after GPa Alex.
  -  Found after a few minutes. Second find of the day. Thanks!!
  -  Found the cache in less than 2 minutes after leaving the trail.  Took Izzy the Traveling Lizard a rock, pen, and pinwheel.  Left a snake, click it, 2 awards, and bubbles.
  -  Very nicely hid.  Still in good shape. Mr Lizard is br still there.  Left one of the Magic Blue Sedona Stones. br The lucky finder will get one wish from it  but it has to be a positive one .  Found this cache with Mr. Kobe.  Thanks.  
  -  Found it with MandaJan.  Even thought my GPS was useless because of the foliage and cloud cover. br TFTH
  -  We were out looking for another cache in the area. Since we didnt find it we decided to look for this one. Good thing we did, didnt want the day to be a complete loss. TNLNSL
  -  After finding the Bond Lakeshore cache my father in law and I went over to search for this one and Good Googalooga since my wife  jklGoDuke  had found them already and I hadnt.  My father in law found this one.  My father in law took a small truck  to give to his only grandson  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle   and I took a small candle in the shape of a bear.  We left a pinwheel and a small biner.  Thanks for a good cache.
  -  my first day of geocaching and only my second find ever, a great search.
  -  Nice cache and neat way to hide it.  The log book is full, had to look for a half empty page.  Otherwise cache is in good shape.  Bond park is very nice and we enjoyed walking the trails. 
  -  Took my mt. bike and set a route of 10 caches. This was the second. My GPS wasnt working great, then I noticed why and reintialized it. Kind of tough due to all the downed trees. TNLN + SL. Covered it better than I found it. Enjoyed it!
  -  Found with jklGoDuke.  Now I have an account of my own!
  -  Found it easily, but I see that its not quite in the same place as the spoiler picture.  My son took a toy car  1940 Ford  and I took a Mardi Gras coin.  We left a Clockwork frizbee, a ring, and a robot.  Thanks for the cache!
  -  2nd of 3 caches we found in Bond Park after a nice picnic dinner this evening.  We ended up taking the long way around, but we got there eventually.  Swapped a BK happy meal toy for the geoGeorge$ that I plan to drop off a long way from home on our family vacation next month. p Its been a week since we got a good rain, but the container seemed reasonably dry when we found it.
  -  There are lots of blown over trees now   thanks to the ice storms last winter.  and it wasnt by the roots anymore, someone must have moved it a little, so stomp around and youll find it too. tn/ln.
  -  Very cool find.  Thanks for the cache....TNLNSL...CACHE ON!
  -  I found this one on bare coords after the Good Googalooga cache, so I first suspected that the clue was on a Coke can artfully hidden under the log.  It turned out that the can was a recently used homemade hash bong.   Maybe it was left by a cacher who was seeking consolation for not finding the cache?  p A little further searching in the area led me to the cache, which had a considerable amount of broken, untradable junk.  I cleaned out the junk and left a geoGeorge$ for trade. p Dont bother looking for the bong.  I dumped it with the rest of the trash on my way out.
  -  1st of 4 found this day. Absolutely perfect weather for Geocacheing. Nice park. Kids were participating in the Easter Egg hunts. TNLN. p Sir & Duchie
  -  This was are third cache for today. I found this one by stepping on it. This cahe needs help from its owner. Everything is wet in it. Thanks for the hunt! br 
  -  The whole Geo Roach team went out searching today.  Found this one with a little bit of work.  It was Mama Roachs first real find.  Wish we had some duct tape to cover the hole that was the lid.  Took nothing, left an eraser.
  -  This was the first of three finds for the day.  Very close to my close to the location of my first cache placement, Good Googalooga.  It was nice to be back in my old stomping grounds, it’s been a while.  My two kids and I had a great time.  The container has a hole in the lid and the contents are a bit soggy.  Luckily the log was dry.  Thanks ryanjimmi. p Happy trails!
  -  Found this one after finding Good Googalooga! ... this one was harder to find, but my GPS got me within a few feet of it.  Evidentally, the cache has moved slightly from where it was originally  based on the pictures I just looked at .  We took the foreign currency left by the last visitor, and left a golf tool and a few other items.
  -  We have never walked in Bond Park before, this was very nice.  We took nothing and left some foreign currency.  Please note there is a crack in the top of the container and the contents are damp.  We really enjoyed looking for this one.  Thanks very much.

  -  Red Wolf Team  12 31 03   1 35 pm br Enjoyed this one. A good hide in a nice park. br TN/left 2 Red Wolf geo badges. Thanks for the fun.
  -   Last of five for the day. Had my wife Eva and our dog satchet with me.  Literally found it by falling in the hole  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_blush.gif border 0 align middle . Log entry from group to find it early in the day indicated they found it the same way.
  -  Found this one with some ease but it was well hidden.  br Please recover your cache, extremely wet. I poured out several ounces of water. Took nothing, left my business card br Signed log. br 
  -  Thanks for the adventure. I guess we walked round and round and made several false starts in and out of the bush on this one. We finally did find it. Things were a little damp...probably needs a service visit with some dry towelettes  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif border 0 align middle . Addison, my 6 year old, chose a prized squashed penny and left a collectors soccer card  in its own baggie . p It was fun exploring the surroundings. Addison even found a baseball out in the woods in one of our false starts. p All in all a great hike. p Cheers, p The Callan Crew
  -  Excellent hide!  Never even knew about this park as I am not originally from here.  Had trouble finding it one time before, but since I was able to find the park I had no trouble locating the cache.  Nicely done. TN/LN
  -  Connor and I found it today under cover of the bike race. No one was paying attention to us bushwacking the last few yards to the container. Cache is in good shape.
  -  We found this one fairly quick.  We had just finished Good Googalooga and this one was very close.  We had 7 kids and a dog with us and they had a great time.  Took nothing left nothing.  Signed book.  CITO.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -   br I am late logging this in. Very strange   I found the cache contents wet, but people coming after me say it is fine. br Nice park, though. Easy to find. p 
  -  Not too hard to find site even without a GPS unit.  Took TB Simi Crash.  SL.  Cryptoclue is a dead giveaway though. br 
  -  Great find after traveling 3000 miles. Tracked our entire trip with the GPS. Left Simi Crash & WG$; took Kates Bug Box & Uncle Elwyn TB. Thanks for the find.
  -  Found this one while in Cary, NC for a wedding.  Found it without too many problems.   As per previous finders, the cache was wet inside.  Poured out water.  Log book was damp.  We had brought Kates Bug Box to NC as we were celebrating the wedding of one of our many Kates.  Now that all but the Kate of Kates Bug Box fame is married off.    p Kates Bug Box wants to travel as far as possible, perhaps leaving the country at some point.   If anyone finds it, please keep it moving. p Uncle Elwyn TB was there.  We decided that we didnt want to have to explain the TB to airport security, so we left it in the cache.  We left a Geocard and took some stickers. p Thanks for the cache.
  -  My wife and I took my son fishing at the park. I decided to take a quick detour to this cache as it was about .13 miles from the parking lot that we parked in. I didnt look at the web site before I went out searching for it, but found it easily just the same. As soon as I saw that up rooted tree, I figured it had to be near there. I signed the log, but didnt take or leave anything. The log book was a little damp. p Thanks.
  -  Man!  That was fun!  It was my first.  I had trouble opening it but pulled my keys out and pryed the lid off.  There was some water inside so i poured that out.  Signed the log and closed her back up.  I didnt take anything because I had nothing to contribute.  This is a fun hobby!
  -  Nice cache.  We are down from Westren NY visting our newest granchild.  2weeks old  It was a delight finding this cache.  We took soccer madness TB and left Uncle Elwyn TB. Will log the take as soon as I have internet with the bug for number needed.  Also took small toy and left small toy.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  My second for the day. Found this right after we found Googalooga.. actually, would have found this first if it werent for some extra foot/paw traffic at the time.. me and the Jasper the Geodog went off to find Googalooga in the meantime.  p Cache recovered in good condition,  although the original BRIGHT green of the tupperware top is starting to show through the paint.  TNLN, signed log.  br 
  -  In the Triad on business; decided to spend Sunday doing some caching Triangle style. p Spent too much time at another set of trees before finally broadening my horizons and making this find.  It was pretty much out in the open, but I presume its lasted this long because the only folks whod venture into these particular woods would be cachers. p Left Soccer TB, TNSL.  Thanks! br  Dave R., Biloxi, MS
  -  Found the cache.  Good hiding spot!  Cache find number two ever for the wife and I.  Took a harmonica.  Left a bottle cap good for a free Mountain Dew.

  -  Second of three today.  Nice easy hike.  Thanks for the hunt.  Left chopsticks   took pink/white car.
  -  This was our 4th find of 6 for the day.  Our first of 3 in Bond Park.  We followed our daughter, 10 and our niece, 12 around the park until they found the spot.  The cache was in plain sight with a tuff of leaves on its top.  We took a super ball and left jewel tattoos. We tried to cover it a little better.  This was a nice find in a nice area.  We enjoyed a picnic under a shelter.  I havent been to Bond Park in 9 years.  Boy has it grown.  Thanks for the hide.   
  -  Took little sis Katie out geocaching for the first time. Good find. Left superball; took nothing. Tried to rehide this one a bit better with leaves.  Thanks!
  -  Here visiting my parents from Asheville. Barely got to this cache before dark and closed gates. I guess everyone else was out looking at fireworks. Found the cache with no problem, TNLN. Thanks!
  -  Found with GodzillaJr. Took nothing, left nothing. br There is a little moisture inside the container. Not suprising br considering the amount of rain we have had this year.

When we lived at Cornerstone apartments, we used to walk the k9 units at Bond all the time.  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle   We just started caching so we didnt have any goodies to trade... we didnt take any either.  We just enjoyed looking through the goodies others had left.
  -  Spent the afternoon exploring Carey area parks and found this one during our travels.   Easy find. p Seems like a nice park    and well have to return some time to rent a boat.  Pleasant walk along the top of the dam.  Watched some young skate boarders doing some really impressive things in the parking lot. p TNLN
  -  Yea, a traditional cache. Ive spent the whole day looking for micros and I needed something that I could actually see and find, it has not been a good day of finding caches, the overcast sky hasnt helped. Left a happy couple and a few memories, I use to work at the ropes course here. Thanks for the hunt, Dogman98

  -  We parked at the community bldg and ate lunch in the van.  Then we hiked the trail straight to the partially uncovered cache.  We took an audio tape, leaving a harmonica and a keyring.  We left Mail My Mom TB too.  Cache is in excellent condition and covered well now.
  -  Good cache ... I enjoyed finding it.  This cache is a short walk from my house so I got in my daily stroll as well as had a great time finding the cache.  Took nothing, left nothing.  The cache needs a new pen or pencil for the log book ... I have to return to the site to finish logging in.  Drafting rules!

  -  This was my sons first cache and he cannot stop talking about it.  p We found it on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  A day that was meant to be experienced outside.
  -  Another great cache at this park. p Walking in we spotted some of the potential hiding spots.  Due to it being a super day out there were lots of people at the park.  We walked around and came at it from the long side so we wouldnt be spotted.  I think that may have made it a little easier to spot from a distance. p TN/LN p LifeTap  &  Wife

  -  Easy find.  I like this lake, its a great place to relax in warm weather or walk any time of year. br Nice paint job on the cache.  It was very visible so I covered it a bit better.

  comments: 
  -  Like others have said before, I walked around my elbow to get to my you know what before finding this cache.  Hide is holding up remarkably well considering all the traffic it is getting.  SL and replaced as found. 
  -  We sure did walk in circles to find this one. Who cares tho, every turn was prettier than the next!
  -  Very lovely spot, though it took us a while to spiral in to the coordinates.  Wacky reads all day long!
  -  Neat spot, never knew it was there. SL
  -  Had a nice day in the gardens
  -  One more new nook in the gardens that we havent tripped down before.  Thanks.  Dropped three coins near the fountain  for my sister to pick up 
  -  What a beautiful little spot for a cache   and to sit and just be. p My sister and her husband each had one of my GPSes and I let them roam pretty much at will.  Of course with my Little Yellows, you do need a compass, so they learned that part, also. p They found it, logged it and we headed off on a tour of the gardens. p Thanks   if I lived here I would be back often. br 
  -  Put my hand on the cache at 6 01 AM . . . perfect time of day for caching in August. Very nicely done, clean & dry, a quick pick is a good start to a long day! THANKS! br Granpa Alex
  -  I town today and out for a hunt with blazingbunny.  Had a nice hike through the gardens to the cache.  I was still looking around as she was retrieving the micro.  Thanks for the garden tour.
  -  I was at Duke yesterday for some medical stuff and decided to do a little caching today with a fellow cacher. br Beautiful gardens and nice find. Thanks for the hide.
  -  Thanks for setting up this cache.  We are so glad we took a look at this beautiful garden! br The Plunketts
  -  Since the GPS reception was very spotty in here, we had to rely on the hint and we found it!
  -  Great little spot. I loved it.
  -  On the way home from the Burlington cache event,stopped off for a little caching. hot day could have drank the water pot dry. TFTH SL
  -  One of 2 quick finds after the East coast premiere event. Pretty little park!
  -  ....
  -  What a beautiful park!  And all those flowers in bloom and all the ducks and turtles!  Really nice.  I wish we could have spent more time there.
  -  First, thanks for the clear hint.  I usuallu dont like them like that, but without it, wed just be tearing up a great little nook. p We found this real quick on a very busy day for the gardens.  We must have waited 20 minutes for a parking place.
  -  Really nice quick cache.  TFTH  TNLNSL
  -  My GPSr was pointing me in the wrong direction, but I found the cache with the clue.  TFTC and a great stroll through the gardens.
  -  Muggles everywhere.... thankfully they werent in this little spot. Found cache with no problems. SL
  -  Replaced the log this morning. Although there was more room on it it was basically falling apart.
  -  Found this one with the hint.  Thanks for showing me this nice garden.   img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_approve.gif border 0 align middle 
  -  I work at Duke and can get over there this week to swap out the log. p Im rather fond of Sarahs Garden since it was the first cache  I found.
  -  What a tranquil pocket in this beautiful garden.  It’s a great place to take a moment and enjoy life.  My girlfriend and I drove over  in our rented 2005 Mustang  from my brother’s place in Cary.  We are in N.C. for my niece’s first communion.  This was our first find on our day trip to Duke.  SL
  -  Could the next searchers of this cache please bring a replacement log?? I wont be back in Durham until July for my wifes annual visit to the Duke Medical Center.  p Since the cache is 35mm film canister, a few small strips of note book paper is all that is needed. p Thanks and happy hunting!!! p Ger
  -  I never would have found this one without decrypting the clue.  A clever hide.  Log is damp and nearly full.  TFTH!
  -  Nice cache in a beautiful area.  It is even easy to be stealthy in a muggle zone.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  This one was pretty well hidden by the last visitor.  Had to resort to decoding the hint.  The cache is pretty damp but br still servicable.  TFTC
  -  Beautiful garden this time of year  and any time of year .  Took us awhile to find it, but were inexperienced.  Had a great time looking!  TFTC!
  -  Very nice hide, easy to find. Lovely day, lots of people mulling around. TFTC!
  -  Was a large reunion gathering and other special events going on all around Duke properties so navigating and finding parking took some time.  I think the parking situation has changed since this cache was first posted.  Perhaps someone local could post an appropriate parking suggestion and email to cache owner so they can update the cache page with current info and people wouldnt feel as awkward parking in maybe the wrong spots.  Seems everything everywhere near had some sort of permit only or designation code requirement.  Not sure if we found a good spot to park or not, but we found a very empty and unused street side section without any obvious parking signage and managed ok. p Found cache after a little searching, but after reading the hint walked right to it.  Beautiful gardens and peaceful spot. p Team Rovery_d1 br rover r us br huggy_d1

  -  Took us awhile to find it. But we did. Good find! 
  -  Ive been to this garden dozens of times but I never saw this little spot.  It must have been a very peaceful place for you while your wife was in the hospital.

  -  Did this one after work on a Monday, and met some other cachers in the process. We liked the hiding place   a very peaceful spot. The Duke Gardens are gorgeous, as always.
  -  Been a while since weve visited the gardens.  Need to come back and spend more time.  Thanks for the hide.
  -  My family and I found it this afternoon. Thanks.
  -  Great park.  It was a easy find and we spent some time admiring the garden.  Ill surely be back this spring.
  -  I cant believe this has been sitting right there for almost an entire year.  I feel like the cache is almost unhidden. p I found this one with Gangstead.
  -  Nice spot in the garden.  Cache paper is starting to get a little water logged.  Unfold gently and carefully.
  -  I am from the Toronto area and was here on business for a few days. Boy, what a fantastic set of gardens you have here at Duke U. I have to make a point of coming back in the summertime, when theres no snow on the ground like there was today! p SL.
  -  An interesting place to visit. Ill have to come back in the spring. Thanks
  -  After an unsuccessful hunt for Hugos Garden Cache, we had a much better time finding this one. This is not really the time of year to visit the Gardens, of course, but the unseasonably warm weather drew lots of folks to the area. Excellent day to be outside, unless youre a GPS   satellites were not cooperating at all, and we had to rely on our wits some. A woman came near walking her cat, and we pretended to be having a romantic couple moment until she went on her way and we could finish up our geocaching business.
  -  Couldnt find it without the clue, though we were close! Log is a bit damp.
  -  Staying at Rolling View Campground in the Falls Lake Recreation Area for the weekend, geocaching was the name of the game, but I got a late start this afternoon. br   br GPSr would not settle down, so it took awhile and I found this one as darkness approached.

  -  Found with lovelace.  Now I have an account of my own!
  -  Found this one before a late lunch.   This is a nice part of the gardens Id never been to before.  Thanks for showing them to me.
  -  What a beautiful garden.  We were especially impressed with the Asiatic garden.  We bought the DVD in the gift shop to remember it by.  Thanks very much
  -  Had some time to kill between singing in two baccalaureate services, so I grabbed a friend and wandered over to the gardens to look for the cache.  Found it gaurded by a garrulous muggle.  Listened for a while; finally had to confess what we were doing to get the cache.  Took coin, left pin, SL.
  -   br Do not show up very early  before 8 00  or you will find the gates locked. Coords were all over the place. Fortunately I had looked at the picture before I left home so I was able to find this one without the GPSr. Good spot. br 
  -  Found with OSWO
  -  Nice spot that Ive enjoyed prior to being a geocacher, so it was great fun to return with a new purpose.  The wife and I were the third to sign this one today!  Not surprising, since the weather and gardens were beautiful.  Thanks for a nice cache!  TNLNSL
  -  Yes, it was a beautiful day.  This is our second find and were still excited.  We left the $ alone and signed the log. We were going to attempt the nearby confluence but decided to walk over and admire the Duke Chapel which is only a few blocks away.   p By the way, the centralized honor system parking meter is a joke.  It ate our 50 cents and never produced a ticket. 
  -  Fun find, beautiful garden. There was a very big spider guarding this one. Took Euro coin, left gold Sacagewea dollar.
  -  Great spot! I pretty much had to stumble across it. Left a 0.10 euro coin.
  -  Enjoyed both hunts. Brought back a lot of memories  Im Duke 94 . Thanks!
  -  What a beautiful place! My kids and I spent about 2 hours here looking at everything and doing a little caching.  Ran into some other cachers, who were also here for the Reunion. Thanks!
  -  Nice Easter Sunday.  Lots of spring flowers blooming and lots of folks around.  Nice hide!  SL
  -  First of two in Duke Gardens. Wonderful area. Will be even nicer in the Spring/Summer when flowers are abloom. Logged Gepetto in and out. Nice hide. Thanks.
  -  Great cache in a great location.  The gardens were busy today!
  -  Went back for a quick visit today.  Replaced the original log at request of Ger and Sarina. New one should last a while...
  -  We found this one after listening to Duke lose to Maryland in the ACC finals.  Thanks for a great cache.  Beautiful day in the beautiful park where we were married!  
  -  This is such a nice place to come and enjoy lunch.  SL
  -  TNSL. The original paper is old and very fragile.  There seemed to be some interesting notes written but I didnt unfold it b/c I was afraid of tearing it apart.  Signed the new log though.  Nice cache in a tucked away spot.
  -  Lemur, visiting from Vermont, found the cache with little difficulty.  Definitely needs a new log sheet.   p Lemur and Otter  Otter is the other half of the furrs geocaching team  got married in the Sarah P. Duke Gardens back in 1997, but have since moved to Vermont.  It was nice to visit, even if just for a short while.
  -  6 25pm  Second cache of the evening, just finished Hugos Garden while visiting the campus.I am here in Durham on a business trip from Minnesota. Must confess had to use the hint. Thanks for the cache, John C.
  -  I have spent a lot of time in this garden, but this is the first time I have been geocaching here. p The cache is intact but the original log is a bit damp. p Thanks for the hide!
  -  What a wonderful garden park!  We hadnt looked at the picture and we were off on a tangent for a while.  Once we read the hint and zoned in on the vicinity, the finding was easy.  The log paper really does need to be replaced!  Thanks for the hunt!
  -  This was our second find while in Durham visiting a relative in the Hospital. We loved the location of the cache. We otherwise probally would not have even seen the garden!  D Thanks for a great cache!
  -  Found this cache on a cold Wednesday.
  -  A little muddy getting to this one today. Used the hint to avoid too much rooting around, and turned out to be looking right at it. The log is swollen and full, but another piece of paper has been added. It is getting difficult to fit everything back in the container, nice spot though. Thanks for the cache. TNLN/SL
  -  Fun find on a nice day in NC!  Clue was key to this find. p  This entry was edited by ncx on Thursday, January 01, 2004 at 7 01 58 PM. 
  -  Found this one with ease after using the hint.  Too many hiding spaces in the area and tree cover makes for poor GPS reception to attempt without a little help. p Thanks for the hide!
  -  Oh my, we dug around quite a few plants looking for this one.  Turned out we were at the wrong waterpot.  Who woulda thunk!!  Dont worry, plants werent damaged and we put everything back the way it was.  Didnt sign the log for lack of pen, but took the feather and left Sacagawea. p NC_WaterSpirit & The Duke Boys
  -  Met another VietNam Vet on the way to this one. Turned br him on to Geocaching. Coords good. SL Thanks, br Snapmower
  -  Red wolf Team    1 24 03    br This was our second try for this one as we didnt br find it on Friday. It was found on saturday so we  br gave it another try and found it this time. I guess br we didnt dig far enough. Signed the log. Thanks for br the hunt and the fun.
  -  We were in town for the Carolina/Duke football game which is an annual tradition. We came with my brother  a Duke alum  and my brother in law  a Durham resident  and his wife. My best friend was married in these gardens and I can remember coming to Easter services here when I was at Carolina and my brother at Duke. Such great memories! So, to the cache! We found the area easily and with the hint we were able to find the cache with a little digging. It is there, but it was under a lot of brush. Some of the log pages are damp, but the last logger put a new sliver of paper that is dry and in good shape. We signed the log and went off to the game in Chapel Hill. Duke won after having lost the last 14 years. I guess it was their time and it was a good game. Thanks for reminding us of our college years and thanks for a good cache!
  -  Hopefully everyone is not tearing down the plants looking for this one. With the relatively light activity for this cache, I doubt this is the case. Maybe the park staff is doing routine maintenance. There is no need whatsoever to tear down the plants to look for this cache. If indeed this is the case, its time to inactivate this cache. I am unable to check on this cache at this time. If someone in the area can check it for me, great. If not, Ill inactivate soon. p Thanks! p Ger
  -  Red Wolf Team  11 20 03   11 30 am br Did not find this one. Looked for a good while and br I think its gone. People are tearing down the br plants looking for this one. If someone else finds it I will go back and look again.
  -  Nov.1st.  br Beautiful day to take the family out for a treasure hunt. br The gardens are looking great! Took us a little while but we did find it.The Log book could stand refreshing. p Jay H.
  -  Visiting nephew from Cincinnati.  Beautiful gardens.  Thanks for the cache!
  -  Decided to go caching in the gardens rather than attend the ill fated Duke Homecoming game. This was more fun. Brought sidekick Krusty Ease and his lovely geocaching novice wife and daughter. The hint sure helped. Log still damp. Thanks for bringing us to this cool spot. 
  -  Found with streamgirl, Jennifer, Holden, and Gracie  see streamgirls log below . p  MarkRebuck,   a href http //www.markrebuck.com/ target _blank visit link /a   
  -  Great spot!  The GPS was bouncing around, but the clue made it an easy find.  The log sheet is still damp.  I live nearby and can replace it if youd like   just shoot me an email.  Thanks for the find!!! p    The Brown Dog Posse  streamgirl, MarkRebuck, Jennifer, and canines Holden and Gracie 
  -  Had to decrypt the hint for this one  turns out I had looked in the right spot, but not hard enough! Was afraid maybe Isabelle had displaced the cache, but instead she just caused the log to be rather damp. Was able to find a small dry spot to sign, but suggest maybe replacing the log sheet at this point. Looks like its also getting mildewy. Thanks for the hunt! br   redpixie and Conan the geodog
  -  Our first find! Found it with rice006, husband and kids. My 4yr old son actually found it with a little eagle eyed help from his dad. Our 2yr old daughter loved the dripping fountain, she could care less about the cache.
  -  First cache.  Enjoyed a cool, quiet afternoon in the Gardens with oldest son, his wife and 2 grandchildren...ages 4 and 2.  Lovely spot.  The log sheets are quite damp and should be replaced or dried out.  Took Euro and left tip of wild turkey feather.
  -  Found this, and I dont even have a GPS device!  The picture was very helpful.  Took a euro coin, left a Canadian quarter.

  -  Catching up my logs that I found with papaw.  br Thanks for the fun. br JO_JO
  -  Found cache in good shape with 6 y/o grandson. Failed to have anything to write with, so I chared a stick with a lighter, then used it to sign the log book. p Thanks br rldill & JO_JO
  -  We found this cache while visiting our son who is a student at Duke medical school.  My wife has a degree in horticulture so we HAD to tour the whole place!  We would still be looking if not for the great hint img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle .  Great fun, a nice walk and beautiful gardens. br Yupbilly,  Pulaski, VA
  -  Always nice to visit these beautiful gardens. Brought back fond memories of college days. The North Carolina humidity makes us appreciate the slightly drier air back home in Austin, Texas. 
  -  Found the cache today, right around lunch time.  It rained here last night. Very humid outside, looks like it is going to rain tonight as well.  Contents of cache intact and in good condition, although the log looks like it is about worn out from so many foldings and unfoldings.  This is my first cache I have ever found as I just acquired my GPS Receiver a couple of days ago.  Had a nice time finding it.  Thanks for the trip. br Chris
  -   A HREF http //operationorange.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br What a fantastic place for a cache!  Weve been meaning to visit this place for a long time, and finally had the chance to.  Signed the log. Thanks for a great cache!  p OperationOrange br Richard, Beth, Rommel br 
  -  The coordinates were dead on! Walked around a bit to get our gps to settle down, but br had no trouble with this one. There is always something differtent to see in this lovely garden. The better half  was feeling a bit under the weather so we didnt linger, but well go back. Thanks.
  -  Wonderful hide.  Got to the right area but had to go back to the truck to read the clue.  Lots of people around on this beautiful day.
  -  I am here visiting from IL. When I first turned my gps on, it had some adjusting to do! It said I was 661 miles from the cache before it registered for the new location I am in. This is a lovely garden, Ive been here many times before I found geocaching. Had the grandmas along with me today. Thanks, enjoyed reminiscing.
  -  Found this one as it was getting dark.  Got there so late the parking meters werent even accepting change any more.   Luckily, I found the cache fairly quickly.  This is really a beautiful place. p NCTreker
  -  Signed in offically this time, forgot a writing implement the first time around.   Took a new cacher, Dr. Phil Beautiful day with two weddings going on.
  -  Went caching on my lunch hour today.  Have spent numerous hours in the gardens, but never at this particular spot.  Log is in decent shape, a little damp, but still able to write on.  The wet spring has made the tree cover pretty dense, could not get a reading right at the cache, so I had to look at a hint... oh well, great day to be outside. Thanks! TwoKats
  -  I hadnt been to the Gardens in a couple of years. Im glad the cache brought me back, especially on such a beautiful day. This was my first attempt at geocaching and I may be hooked.
  -  Thank you for this cache.  I visited it on Sunday  May 4, 03  and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The location is a wonderful place to sit and reflect on the beautiful things around us.  And ... since I am in the process of designing a garden in an Asian theme, the surroundings were inspirational.
  -  Small but interesting find. p Took nickel and left a Peso to fit with the foreign money theme.
  -  A lot of people were present for a plant sale.  We saw a van from our former church in Lumberton.  We found the cache easily and signed the log.  We bought hot dogs from a vendor at the plant sale.
  -  Found this w/ Jiri and family while visiting him in Durham.  Been to the gardens a few times before with Jiri, not knowing this cache was here.  Took nothing, left a Singapore Bill.
  -  Found this one sans the rest of the Krew.  Visited the gardens on Easter and found the grounds awe inspiring.  No writing stick to note my visit in the log but wanted to compliment the cacher on the location.  Congrats on the prognosis.
  -  Nice spot.  We go to the gardens often but hadnt seen this little spot.  Nice
  -  Enjoyable walk through the Sarah Duke Gardens.  We experienced our first unassisted cashe find.  The coordinates were perfect, on our GPS we were within 3 feet, and had little trouble finding the cache.  We had previously questioned the GPS as we were unable to locate Bookcache after two different attempts. We forgot a pen or pencil to enter our find, but hope to return later in the week.  The garden was extremely busy and with Easter being this weekend parking will be very limited.  Great fun.
  -  Found it.   p I went with HelixBlue to the Duke Gardens at Lunch time.  Found this one and then took some photos of flowers. p Very nice afternoon to go geocaching!  Im glad that spring time has arrived! p Chris
  -  What a beautiful day in the gardens!  I have been here several times and never saw this particular spot, so thank you for showing us a new, peaceful place to sit and relax.  The only trick is to log in without drawing attention to oneself....
  -   A HREF http //toadstool.sh/ target _blank Users web page /A  br I went with Sallad to this cache. It was the first time Id been to the garden, and I had a great time finding it. If it wasnt for the hints, I would not have found it within my lunch period    
  -   A HREF http //www.ibiblio.org/sallad/gallery/geocache target _blank Users web page /A  br Helixblue and I found this during our lunchbreak.  I walked over from my office at Duke and he met me in the parking lot.

  -   A HREF http //www.justmike.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br Wow.  Truly was a beautiful day to be in the gardens.  Although not very colorful in the winter, this was still a very peaceful spot to visit. p The log was wet, and I had only brought a pencil so was unable to sign it.  I laid it out to dry out a bit, but suggest the keeper retreive the log and replace it with dry paper.  I did leave a mini BadtzMaru eraser to prove my visit.     p   Badtz
  -  Found it pretty easily; coordinates were right on. Saw ducks, a blue heron, and a redtail hawk. Listened to the water and the cathedral bells. br Thanks for the peaceful moment in this spot.  br PS Log pages are almost full.
  -  Duke Gardens has to be one of the truly lovely places to visit in North Carolina! Have been here many times, as had most cachers who left notes. My faithful yellow Etrex couldnt seem to hone in as at other sites. Went around in circles for a while! Found the cache only after checking the cheat. The hiding spot certainly is unique    good job! Hopefully the gardening staff will not find it by accident! Two sheets of notepaper in one tiny 35 mm film container    neat. It was so cold that only pansies were in bloom, but come anyway. Thanks from me and alpacafarmer, who was with me before heading back home to snowy West Va. tomorrow. p  last edit  12/29/2002 2 18 42 PM PST 
  -  Merry X Mas from The Alethiometrists! This was our first find with our new E Trex Venture  with thanks to our Santa, Jens dad . It got us to the right general vicinity, under tree cover, then Jen decrypted the clue to get us to the exact location. TNLN.
  -  Nice easy find.  Very nice area.  I plan to return in the spring, it must be beautiful then.  Of course I forgot a pencil and didnt feel like walking back and forth again, so I tore off the coordinates from the geocaching printoff as evidence of my visit.  There is still room on the papers for more logs.  Thanks.  
  -  Thanks for showing me this place.  The gardens were worth the trip.  Found cache and took photos a several travel bugs enjoying the area.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  Very nice... though Im a die hard Tarheel, I must admit that Duke Gardens makes the UNC botanical gardens look like East LA. p The GPS got us within 20 feet, but still on a different path... took us a while to locate the spot. Great hide, and Im so happy that Sarah won her battle!
  -  First find of the day and a great place to start the morning.  Found the cache without too much trouble.  Thanks for a cache in such a beautiful place!
  -  This was our second find of the day  second find ever, for that matter .  The asiatic garden was very pretty.  We found several water pots     br We also saw a rabbit  runnig away from us, so all we really saw was his tail and back feet  when we came off of the zig zagging bridge. p Wendy,Gordon
  -  Even though I am a diehard State Fan, I have to admit this was a pretty place.  Signed the log.   p GO WOLFPACK!!!! p The Abbie Dogs

  -   A HREF http //www.jankout.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br Found this one without too much trouble. The coordinates were dead on and I looked in the most obvious place. Very cool! We left a Canadian quarter.
  -  cool site.  I will have to come back and walk around a bit more.
  -  I think we over pay the parking lot it took us about 15 minutes in and out and we pay 75 cents. Tks. 4 the fun
  -  Our first cache! It was pretty well hidden, but not too hard. The canister doesnt seal exceptionally well, so the contents are a little damp. Thanks for getting us out to the gardens ... hadnt been out there in a while.
  -  Was actually here interveiwing for a job and went to find it after the interview.  Had been on campus before  OK just the football stadium  but this is a very beautiful location.  Cache was closed tight but the log was a tad wet. Dried everything out and closed it up tight.  br Thanks for the hunt!
  -  very enjoyable cache.  found without much trouble, spent next hour wandering gardens.  glad to hear all is well with your family.  thanks for the hunt p Fishingfools br 
  -  Found this one easily after a short walk in the gardens.  Beautiful day, lovely gardens despite the water shortage.  The Asian garden is looking especially nice.   br Great outing; thanks for the hunt! br

  -  Found this one very easily. We often come to the gardens but we had not found this spot before, kind of hidden away! Thanks.
  -  In a neat little nook Id overlooked in previous visits to the gardens. It would be a very relaxing place if it werent for the incessant hum coming from the hospital! Visited this one with joyride, who found the goods. My Meridian got us within 2 feet, even with all the tree cover  at least after Id put the correct coords in   a keying error had us in the native plants area a tenth of a mile away initially! . We forgot the pencil, so we signed the log with a pointed stick! Thanks for the pretty walk, and best wishes to your wife/mom   glad to hear shes doing well!
  -   My first first! It was a muggy morning. Had a little trouble finding it.  Looked in a nearby bush. It was pretty deep down in there. The surroundings were very pretty.

  -  I might have caused some confusion if I happened to leave the snake geobutton that refers to being cold blooded. It can be used as a First To Find button, but I might have been thinking it fit the area.  If you are warm blooded and not ruthless as implied, then it is appropriate for you to take it.  Again, sorry for the confusion.  spider99
  -  Its always nice to go for a hunt in Bond Park.  You can even forget you are in the middle of Cary!  GPS brought me right to the spot, but not before I had to ask a black snake to move off the path.  I about stepped on him, too busy looking for the cache!  Signed log, forgot to leave poem, took nothing.  Found FTF button with the log book, but didnt seem right to take it.  Should I have?
  -  Found between ball games. Didnt have anything with me to trade so TNLNSL. Loved the park.
  -  #5 of the day for our Cary Caching Marathon... p Took Nazar TB   left $1 p SL   TFTH
  -  Found with friends while recovering from a Wolfpack loss.
  -  Found this cache with some friends on a geocaching adventure to Bond Park for the first time.
  -  Spiders everywhere!!!  Felt like we were on survivor!  Here with some newbies, Geodog and Geocat.  Took a spider pencil, left a geobutton.  Trade items were pretty picked over, but it was still fun to find it exactly as described.  TFTC!  spider99
  -  Great find! Not real hard for the beginners.
  -  Nice Monday morning find.  No muggles anywhere nearby.  TNLNSL
  -  A nice find while walking throught the park today.  TFTH, TNLN.
  -  Spent alot of time looking in a similar but wrong caching  br location. I was on my way out and found the right caching location. Took a riddle book and left a stuffed snake. TFTH. br 
  -  It is always fun to find caches that have been around for a while. We were visiting the area from Southern California. On advice from a local cacher, we took a walk around this lake. p At first we thought we might have to cross a stream. Good thing we didnt have to. p The cache is in great shape. p Thanks, p Team Geo Jedi

  -  Nice hide.  1100101 and i were out for a day in Bond Park.  From this cache we went on to feed the ducks, play on the playground, ride a boat, and look for another cache.  This is a great location.  Took a few moments to enjoy the cool spring air and lush vegetation.  Nearby creek was relaxing too.  1100101 took a little rubbery porcupine guy and a truck and we left a mini videogame and some Christmas mice.  I put a new bag around the log since the big one has a hole right near the zipper.
  -  First cache for us! My wife, two daughters  ages 1 and 4 , and I went out for this one. We found it to be just right for a first cache. Its nice and secluded now that the foliage has filled in. Despite being relatively close to a trail and having a major town of Cary function going on in the park, we didnt have to worry about the public. p We tried two ways to access the cache location. The first, which seems like it should be the main route, is starting to get choked off by briars. It was too grown over to get through without blood being drawn. We turned around and tried a second, which was a slightly discernable social trail. That route ended in success.  D p We took a small plastic snake and an eraser, and left a mechanical duck.
  -  Second of two today with the whole crew and Otterdude. p Left snake, took mini videogame thing. p Thank you!!
  -  What a surprisingly nice day it was for this trip.  Had no idea that all that extra area was down there in the park.  We normally just go canoeing!  Ended up spending the day there enjoying the weather.  Great hide!
  -  Wow, talk about feeling in the middle of nowhere!  What a great hide!  After wandering around for a while we broke down and decrypted the clue figuring wed be there forever! p TNLN. p Thanks!
  -  2nd of 3 today with Handy Find   I picked up travel bug Snoopy to take to a new home!
  -  Found with Feather today, glad to finally do the Bond Park Caches!
  -  A great day for a walk in the woods! TFTH!
  -  Second find of day with friend KD.  Several kids playing in water nearby made it tricky to be discreet.  Nice spot though.  Great for sitting and reflecting.  Took a few minutes to empty the container and clean it out    leaves and such.  Very sparse on the tradeables. TN.  Left kooshie, mini biners, and kazoo.  TFTH
  -  We found this one 1st of the three caches we searched for today. We certainly enjoyed the privacy of this one. We enjoyed having time to sit and read the log entries from way back. We took a little tiny circuit board, and a Gill doll  from Nemo . We left a flower eraser, and a little plastic dump truck. Very pretty spot! TFTH
  -  It was a chilly overcast day, but a nice one for geocaching in the woods. Thanks for the hide!
  -  NICE walk in here today.  We were passed by one jogger and stopped to have a nice talk with a woman out birding... shed located a warbler of some kind  yellow spot on its back  so we stopped to marvel over this with her...  thankfully, it was painless.  Birder, I am not. p Can found easily enough.... but boy, this baby needs an overhaul.  Someone, make a run to the dollar store, stat!   And take a trash bag with you to get rid of all the crap in the can when you swap it out!  p Fun to see just how long its been out and that the log book  put in 6 months after the cache was planted  is still going strong.
  -  Got off the trail from the community center a little early and stmped through some extra bits of ground cover.  Found pretty quickly, and it looked like we were the 2nd visitor fo the day.  Saw a snake and a rabbit.  Thanks!
  -  No problems finding this one. Nice location. Thanks. TNLN
  -  Found this after a nice walk inteh woods with the whole family.  This was my 2 year olds first find.  She took a South Dakota pencil and left a dinosaur pen.  The park was packed and we hit CoCarys Bond Park Cache earlier, then spent some time at the playground.
  -  Quick dash after work today. Nice hide! Took pink pencil and a page from the log book, and put them in CamoCan Cache, since it needed it! Left a Slim Jim. Signed log. TFTH
  -  Found this easily enough during a nice hike at Bond Park.  Lots of folks were out taking advantage of a mild winter day.  A took an eraser and left a glow stick.  Thanks!

  -  First outing to find a cache had a great time looking
  -  Left a rubber snake and took the Wheres George bill. We guessed wrong initially and ended up on the wrong side of the creek before correcting our mistake and finding the cache.  Thanks for the hide.
  -  This would have been a great walk if it the weather had been better.  We will probably all be sick from searching in the ice and rain.  Had a blast though.  Neat tree!
  -  Nicely done.  The oldest cache I have seen.  GC242   The 242nd cache listed?  Cool
  -  No travel bug. Enjoyed the walk.
  -  Our GPS ran out of juice as we neared but we were close enough to find it. We enjoyed the walk on the crisp day! TFTH!
  -  5th of 6 finds at Bond Park, including some letterboxes. Most of the hike was in the drizzle, but nothing unbearable. Between the orienteering map and the spoiler photo, this was an easy find right before sunset. TFTC.
  -  Nice walk in the park today. Muggles were plentiful. Dropped off the Grandma Kipp travel bug. Took a whoopie cushion and left an M&M puzzle, signed log. TFTC
  -   Took the long way,  and had to cross the stream.  But found in about 15 min. or so.  We took the pence and left an Austrailian dollar. 1st of our 2 finds today. Good job on the local. Nice find!   
  -  Since we were already nearby, we decided to try this one as well.  Excellent cache and it was clear this one had been around a while.  We spent quite a while looking through the log book.  Signed the book, left the Whoopie Cushion and took the T.P.
  -  We started GeoCaching today and found this site after visiting CoCarys Bond Park Cache. This one took us a little longer to find. Our GPS gave us conflicting directions after we got within a hundred yards and we were a little careless. We did find it at last   and discovered a wet paper booklet for kids among the cache. We didnt take it out though as we hand nothing to put back. I guess these things all need to be in plastic bags. p Thanks for the hunt and the new hobby.
  -  This was a great find.  We found a lizard guarding the cache.  Walked across a log to find it.  This was the hard way; there are easier ways.  The travel bug is enroute to FL.
  -  We took some friends who are new to this with us and had a fantastic time.  Didnt have any trouble once we got into the area, but there were some obsticles in the way  we will say no more . p Great hide, and great stuff.  Thank you for the hide.
  -  Found this cache this afternoon.  Took a Soccergirl figure, left a Y50 coin.  Left the Mt. Kili Travel Bug #448595 in the cache.  Didnt see the other travel bug, but my daughter was so excited with the soccer figurine that was just about all she noticed. p Jerome, Rache, Chuck.
  -  My grandsons first find. This was a great one to introduce him to the adventure.  Im here from California for Christmas and plan on finding more! br Took blue smiley face button, left blue hotwheels car.
  -  Hi my name is James. I am Papa Johns grandson. This was my second time geocaching. It took about 10 minutes to find the cache. I took a key chain and put a golf ball candle in its place. 
  -  We like Bond Park caches a lot.  Traveled through a lot of brush, luckily it wasnt the middle of summer.  Thanks  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle 
  -  Enjoyed this one with a chuckle after going around stream 3 times!  Thanks for the hide.
  -  Found with two grandchildren, first time geocaching  for them .  Everything in box was very damp. TNLN, but introduced two more children to the game.  TFTH
  -  Found it pretty quickly once I figured out which side of the stream I needed to be on. Assumptions led me astray twice! TNLNSL  Thanks!
  -  This was a great cache for our second find of the day.  Did not use the cheat but almost needed it.  Momma found it for the team.

  -  Nice hide!  I found this while in the park w/ my little brothers cub scout group setting off rockets.  I was able to find this and 2 others while I was here.  TNLN

  -  Quick caching! Cool cache! br out Yo yo br  in Mctoy,badge br in/out Blueberry TB br Thanks for the smiley! br Rixart Huluvu,Emilymaus
  -  Went looking for PFC Bug but it wasnt there?  Passed by on the trail, but had a feeling from your hints that it was closer to the trail than my GPS was indicating.  So we walked around looking for a parallel trail.  Never found that trail.  Took a longer trail through the woods to get to the hiding spot   took the short cut out.
  -  A fun find today with my 9 year old step son, who spotted it right away. Took nothing, left a glow in the dark star and a Canadian Loonie.
  -  Nice hide, good cache . . . the area and cache in super condition, hard to believe over two hundred friends preceded me. THANKS br Granpa Alex
  -  Our fourth of five today, just a little after GPa Alex made his visit.  We saw a bit of PI on the trail in so step wisely!  TN/LN   there was no TB.
  -  Found with Ham_BOne
  -  Quick find while searching for other caches in the park. br Did not notice the TB in the cache. br TNLNSL   Thanks for the cache.
  -  Our first find! br My son and I found this one not to far from our house. br Great fun!
  -  Came looking for the TB but it was gone.  Took a spin top, plastic boat and gold pen.  Left a Tiger, spin top, samuri figure.
  -  Found with my father in law after finding CammoCan cache.  My father in law had borrowed the GPSr  a Garmin GPS12  my wife currently has  on loan from a friend  and was using it to navigate to the cache.  He was using the screen that lists the 10 closest caches and updates their relative location and direction in real time.  What he didnt realize was that it also orders them by closest in real time too!  So, all of a sudden he started saying, its this way and my GPSr was saying it was the other way!  Needless to say, things got a bit confusing.  Once we figured out, though, that this cache had moved up in the list we headed out in the right direction.  The area was pretty well overgrown and it was getting dark but we managed to go for a bit and then reach a clearing so I could get a better satellite lock.  After that, I had a pretty good bearing on the cache and headed around an obstacle.  I went for a bit and then said, hmm... it should be getting close.  I turned on my flashlight, shined it forward and voila! there was the cache.  By this time it was getting fairly dark under the forest canopy so Im glad we found it when we did.  Took a small frisbee and left a pinwheel.  When I got back to the car and showed the frisbee to my wife she laughed because apparently it was the one she left in the cache when she found it several weeks ago!  Oh well.   img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle   Thanks for a good cache.
  -  very fun search, one of my first ever, this stuff is fun.
  -  Nice cache, enjoyed ourselves at the park which has very nice trails.  Took the hardway in to the cache through thick brush  but found an easier way back out.  Cache is in good condition.  TNLNSL.  
  -  Took my mt. bike and set a route of 10 caches. This was the third. Had to wait for the muggles to clear out before I could really search. Nice spot. TNLN + SL. Covered it better than I found it. Enjoyed it!
  -  Took us a while, i guess the dense leaves were messing with our signal.  Lots of spiderwebs!
  -  Found with jklGoDuke.  Now I have an account of my own!
  -  Walked right by it at first   guess my geocaching instincts are a little too firmly rooted, so to speak.  Then I sat my toddler down on a log and found it on the second pass.  We took a helicopter and a wooden knob, and left a toy  my mind is going   Ive forgotten what toy we left!  and a lobster.
  -  This was the last of the 3 caches we found on our first evening geocaching.  A bit further off the path than I was expecting & we ended up walking past it twice before I started trusting the GPS enough to do what it told me!  Good thing I had decrypted the additional hints before leaving home.  Signed the logbook & my 6YO swapped a batman action figure for a pin that caught his eye.  Thanks for the walk through a part of Bond Park wed never been to.
  -  My wife wanted to visit Spring Days at Bond Park this year, so I went with her... and while she was checking out the vendor booths, I went geocaching for the first time.  The cache was a bit further off the beaten path than I was expecting, but I finally reached the general vicinity.  My GPS was accurate to about 25 feet, so I was pretty close.  This being my first hunt, I didnt know what to expect.  I first looked around to see if the cache was in plain site, but it didnt seem to be.  Then I started looking in holes in the ground, etc.  Still no luck.  I was about to leave  a bit disappointed  when I noticed a debris pile that looked more man made than natural.  I poked at it with a stick  hoping I wasnt about to make some wild animal angry , and there it was!  My first geocache find!  It was fun to see what others had left there.  I didnt bring anything to leave in it myself, so I didnt take anything either.  I just signed the log and returned it to its hiding place.  Thanks for the fun introduction to geocaching!
  -  This was my kids second cache   they had fun.  tn/ln
  -  Its always great to find a venerable cache.  This one was #578 on the approval list, making it one of the oldest ones Ive yet found.  I suspect it has brought many folks to the sport. p The park where the cache is hidden was worth the visit and the cache remains loaded with excellent trade goods.  TN, left a geoGeorge$ and signed the log.
  -  Came with my brother and two of his daughters.  TNLN...Thanks for the cache...CACHE ON!
  -  Great park, Ill have to come back another time when I can enjoy the trails. Took the travel bug and left a kazoo. Thanks for the hunt...Kazoo p 
  -  Nice cache and walk.  Love doing caches in NC. It seems the PFC went awol.  Left signature button and a TB 
  -  2nd find of 4 this day. Just a short walk from previous find. Saw a snake in the creek. Easy find even though we did not take the most direct route. Took a toy farm tractor and left a stuffed white bear. Thanks for the cache. p Sir & Duchie
  -  This was the last of the four caches we looked for and found while visiting Cary from Aiken, SC for the weekend soccer tournament.  I was extremely surprised how easily we found this one without much of a map of the city, and no map of the park.  The hint was indespensible though.  This one was found by John.  We didnt see any travel bugs which was unfortunate since we wanted to give one a lift south, but we did get an extremely close look at a Great Blue Heron which was sweet.  Thanks for the adventure.
  -  Found this one after about 5 minutes of looking around. Neither of the two Travel Bugs listed are in there, though. TNLN. Thanks!
  -  This was our fourth cache for the day. Nice cache. I looked and there are no TBs in this cache. Thanks for the fun hunt!!
  -  Found this with my GPS this time.  I first found this cache over a year ago by accident hiking through the woods. Reading your log book was the first time I had heard of Geocaching.  So I left your cache there and went home and looked up this web site.  It looked like fun, so I got a gps and now hunt geocaches.  Thanks for the great introduction to Geocaching!
  -  The whole Geo Roaches crew went out searching today.  Found this fairly quickly.  Nice Cache. Thanks!  Took clicker and Donald Duck head, left glue stick and post it notes.
  -  We made the same mistake another did.  We were on the correct side of the creek, but our navigator  me!  thought the cache was on the other side.  Once on the other side, we realized we were ok to begin with.  Three of the kids with us managed to cross the creek  both times  on an old tree fallen across the creek, while those us more cautious  sane?  took the bridge.  We left various items, including a Carolina Hurricanes window sticker  go Canes! .
  -  Real nice walk in a park we have never visited before.  We were on the right side of the creek and got mixed up and went around to the other, then found that we had to go back around.  Thanks very much for a real nice part of our caching day.

  -  I saw this one before Dad did, I took a vegie tales keychain.
  -  We just stopped by for a walk in the woods and to help the travel bugs listed as being here on their way.  The only one that was in the cache was Little Pieces.  Both, Just Buggin and PFC Bug, Army of One, have gone AWOL.  I will place Little pieces in a new cache in the next few days. p Thanks for the time in the woods with my daughter. p Jabba and The Tater
  -  Great hiding spot not to hard to find. Thanks a bunch for having the cache.
  -  We struggled a little to find this one, but our 7 year old finally found it.  Didnt take anything, just filled in the log.
  -  We did this cache while doing the series of 3 Bond Park letterboxes.  I think we took the wrong trail because we had to traipse through the woods pretty far, but we still found it!  Left Little Pieces TB.
  -  Red Wolf Team  12 31 03    1 45 pm br Park was crowded and had to wait for people to clear out  br to find this one. Nice hide. TN/left 3 Red Wolf  badges. br Thanks for the fun.
  -  Fourth of five for the day. Had my wife Eva and our dog satchet with me. I Spotted it first, but let Eva find it img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle .
  -  My six year old, Addison, spotted this one today. We had passed it and had to double back. This is relatively near another cache also located at Bond Park. Probably a good dual for local cachers. p Glad to see that you are using the reliable standard cache container, as all the items were nice and dry. Addison took a plastic bug  as opposed to a travel bug  and left a toy train car. We signed log. It was an excellent day to be out to walk off some of the Christmas turkey. p Thanks for the find. br 
  -  Thought this might be the last cache of the day, but I was able to squeeze one more micro in afterwards.  TNLN, but enjoyed the search!
  -  Found the Good Googalooga, TN but left a new bug. I left  br PFC Bugg, Army of One. I wish for him to continue his journey. br 
  -  This was our first of three today.  We walked along the path thinking we would get closer.  We walked all the way around it until we came to the softball field.  We began walking to the point and had to cross the small stream, not bad unless you have 5 small kids.  We found it fairly quick after that.  Took the gold coin and toy dog.  We left the batman and plastic bug.  Thanks for the hunt.  CITO
  -  Absolutely gorgeous day to be walking in the woods. p I dropped my camera case by the lake, and five minutes later when I went back to look for it, it had disappeared. p I saw no TB in the box. br 
  -  Must have just missed FinnInFla.  Easy find nearby to another.  Quick hike in and hike out.  Signed log, TN/LN. br 
  -  We had a bit of trouble finding which path to take from the parking lot.  It was our very first Geocache!  We took the Nemo travel bug and are going to put in in a cache in Asheville, where we are going tomorrow.  We left a few items and our girls had fun picking a few items out.  A great first find   
  -  Found with Mothra. br Took a toy car and Chicken Run stickers. br Left a Rescue Heros Helicopter. p Took us 3 different paths to get to the cache.
  -  Found cache. br Left Finding Nemo travel bug br Took Stealth travel bug.
  -  Lucy and I cleared out all of the spider webs in the area and made sure all the mosquitos were well fed!!! p The cache wasnt covered up very well, so I put some more sticks on top. TNLNSL p 
  -  It was a nice morning, and I thought me and my dog needed a good cache... Well, what we really needed by the end was a good bath! The rain had really muddied up the surrounding area and trails, but it was a good find. One thing about a cache that has been around a while.. even the mistakes start forming paths. Found a path and thought this must be it... Me and the Geodog soon found ourselves on the wrong side of the creek a few hundred feet from the cache...  p Cache was found in good condition   TNLN, signed log. 
  -  In the Triad on business; decided to spend Sunday doing some caching Triangle style. p Well, I spent the better part of the morning on my flights over here reading the endless articles about Tobey Maguire in that new Seabiscuit movie.  Well just call ME Tobey Maguire...Spiderman!  I walked face first through at least 4 webs on the way to this one...blecch.  In between fighting tree canopy and flailing my arms around to get the webs out of my mouth, somehow I walked right up to this one.  The caching gods were smiling on me. p Left Stealth TB, TNSL.  Thanks! br  Dave R., Biloxi, MS
  -  Found the third and final cache of our day  my birthday!! .  Good spot although we got a little nervous that we were on the wrong side of the creek!!  Had nothing left to leave, but took a polished rock.
  -  Second trip to this cache. Waah  someone got the California Bear travelbug before us. TNLN.
  -  Wow!  What a hike...we walked faster than the GPS could keep up...so we ended up walking past several times.   We are a bit new at this   Great spot.  Left pink/white car   took caterpillar. p  last edit  7/18/2003 7 19 48 AM PST 
  -  This was our 5th find of 6 today and our 2nd in Bond Park.  The description read Due to the visible nature . .   Do not expect this cache to be visible.  It is a good ways in the woods and does require bushwacking.  There were no travel bugs in the cache. The cache was in good condition but needs refreshing.  Thanks for the hunt.  This is a beautiful park with lots of possibilities.

  -  Hello  p This was the first of Two caches today.  I had planned on picking up the two travel bugs that are listed as being here, but they were gone.  I guess I should have read the other logs, as the last person reported this also. p I used to work at the ropes course here at Bond park and it was nice to be out there again.  The Geo Hounds loved the creek, and enjoyed many swims.  The tree cover is so heavy out there that the GPS seemed as it could not be trusted.  Little did I know that I was standing just feet away from it at one point before I went back to the trail to get a new reading and then head back in.  One thing that I tried that may work for others is that I used my old reliable magnetic compass to help find the way.  I would tell the GPS to go to a different waypoint when it seemed confused, and then once it had a reading on that one, I would switch back to Googaloogas cache.  Then, I could get a compass heading to follow on the GPS, and go in that direction with the magnetic compass. p Thanks for the fun, p Jabba and his Geo hounds  Samba and Ripple the Choc and Yellow Labs 
  -  I was in Bond Park with my Daughter to do the Orienteering Class that is given second Sat of every month. No GPS just a compass But I bought along the GPS so that afterwards my daughter and I could look for this cache. This is our first find! We took the shells and left behind a Caterpillar from a Taco Bell Bug Kids Meal. Cache is in excellent shape.
  -  Found the cache while exploring Raleigh area parks on a beautiful June day. p GPS acting up as usual under heavy tree cover and took a bit a searching to find this one.  Note that cache is several hundred feet off the trail and some non trivial bushwacking is required.  May not be one for small children. p Picked up MARINE CORPS SPECIAL FORCES.   Didnt see JUST BUGGIN or CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR BEAR but may have missed them as we were only expecting to find one TB in this cache. p  last edit  6/3/2003 12 17 17 PM PST 
  -  This was our second find.  We are so new at this that we didnt know we could click nearby cashes.  I found out today at work that there were 2 more within feet of this one.... wonder we hadnt stumpled onto them!  We took a pencil, pen, toy car, book mark, the round tuit, and the measuring tape.  Left a Nemo fish, 3 blue glass rocks, book mark, the Marine Corps Special Fources travel bug, and a pocket size pack of tissues.  The log book bag was torn down the side.  Well probably go back this weekend for the other cashes and leave a new bag if needed.  Thanks.
  -  Nice walk in a park we didnt know existed. br Nice container and paintjob. Left some stuff br and took a pen. Thanks
  -  Nice walk.  Great paint job on the cache.  Took a Slinky and Bird Cage.  Left 4 pencils, Mr. Potato Head, and Tigger. p Thanks, br Dan, Peg, Adam, & Ryan.

  -   A HREF http //www.ibiblio.org/sallad/gallery/geocache target _blank Users web page /A  br I found it after getting really lost.  Originally I mistyped the coordinates and ended up on the corner of Chatham St. and Cary Parkway, but I knew I was near Helixblues place so I called him and got a ride back to my car at Bond Lake to start over with corrected coords.   p I found a neat, asleep little fuzzy bat hanging upside down near the cache too. p See website for more photos.
  -  My second find of the day.  The cache was in good condition, and well covered.  Great Park!  I took a Canadian coin, and in keeping with the Gold theme, I left a small mesh gold colored box.  Thanks for the cache! p Note   I did NOT find a travel bug in this box, but maybe I just overlooked something.    p  last edit  3/15/2003 5 11 47 PM PST

  -  Nice hiding place. Wonderful day to be out in the woods after the months of cold weather we have had. p Took nothing, left nothing. p Everything was dry and in good shape. The next person could take a new ziploc for the log book. The current one is torn. p Thanks, br bdaniel

  -  Great day to go geocaching.  Dropped off TB Just Bugging in this cache hope he finds another to travel with shortly.    Brown007rn, Biltmore, and Savannah. 
  -  Found it. It was snowy everywhere! The kids and dogs had a good time, but beware the briars. Took Mardi Gras coin. Left travel Parcheesi Game. Didnt find a travel bug!
  -  Started out with this cache today, my buddy had found this one before so the pressure was on!  Walked around and found the area as told by the GPS.  Spun in circles for a short bit before realizing I was practically standing on the cache.  Good hike and a nice hiding spot. p t/ln p LifeTap
  -  Cold!
  -  Good  albeit chilly  cache.  We had just done Cats at Bond Park as well and by the time we hiked all the way over, we were pretty bushed!
  -  Second visit to this cache.  Came with LifeTap and brought Congo.  Took Whistler TB.  Left nothing.  Cache was in good condition.
  -  We didnt log our earlier unsuccessful visit, back on the day we did Cache as Cats Can, back before we had a GPSr. But now, thanks to our e Trex Venture, we can log our success. We returned to the scene to launch our first travel bug, Whistler, from this highly auspicious geocache. Also auspicious, its our 13th find  Kens lucky number . Amelia did all the work on this one, and took a little doll. Along with our travel bug, we left a Canadian tooney, from the stash of coins left from our recent trip to British Columbia  where Whistler is eventually headed . p PS   I was told by an earlier visitor that he picked up the California State Fair travel bug, and it should be at a cache near Ft. Bragg now. p  last edit  1/21/2003 8 40 47 AM PST 
  -  Great cache.  Didnt find a TB though!  Left some little toy and took a McToy.
  -  Back for a third  !!  visit, took the boys and some good friends. The kids had a blast. Seems a lot of geocachers got their start on this cache,  including me. 
  -  Treasure hunting with Daddy, brother, and our friends. I took a ring, left a toy. I liked throwing rocks in the creek. 
  -  Found the cache again with my little brother. We took two rings and left some cards. Thank you!
  -  found this one pretty quick and easy.  loved the military style box.  well hidden.  took a newport news pen and left a black keychain. br brian west
  -  My first find!  Just got my Meri Plat for Christmas and hiked out to find this cache today.  Was glad to see the toilet tissue in the cache as my dog found something unsavory to roll in while hunting.  Took nothing  except for a few squares of TP  and left some Silly Putty.  Thanks for a great first hunt!
  -   br   Little muddy and farther off the trail than we expected.  Looked like the cache was in good condition.  Took nothing, left nothing. p   Brandon & Shirley from Cary, NC
  -  I found this cache today first one ever.  A hard one to find if you havent gone out and bought a GPS yet  me .  Here is the one thing you need to know to find it, it is the trail beside the pipe coming from the lake.  At the bench it is located across from it.  It is a trail and after the ice storm be prepared to climb over down branches and newly growing thorns.  I did find a travel bug and plan to move it on.  I left a tape mesure and some bullet shells my friend and i found with his metal detector AT BOND PARK.  Feel free to email me but no spam.  I handed the travelbug on to my teacher who is involved in geocaching.  he is moving the bug onto a spot in fort bragg. p  last edit  12/30/2002 8 46 26 AM PST 
  -   This was my second find, just after Cache as Cats Can.  Very nice cache!  This is what I hoped geocaching would be like when I started  and what my first few attempts werent .  Left a travel bug from the Triangle meeting, took trash.  Thanks!  p Theres a discernable path from the bench on the trail straight toward the cache    clearly, G.G. has succeeded in drawing many visitors!  I dont think its any danger to the environment, just a flatter line in the carpet of leaves.
  -  Easy find,  nice trail system.
  -  Revisited this one while at Bond Park for the Cache as Cats Can cache.  These two should be done in tandem.  Did the loop around the lake    great hike!

  -  We arrived at the park to find some sort of track and field event going on.  College runners everywhere! We managed to find the cache without any runners spottiing us.  We took the IlluvianSektnetG Travel Bug and we left a card on Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a paddle drum, a sucker ball, and a painted drawer knob.  Thanx for the hunt. p Jeff, Traci, Wes and Sid br The Davis Family
  -  My very first cache. My six year old son Connor and I found it together. It was his first too. Thanks for the nice walk. He was very excited! Left some play coins and a token for the Boardwalk in Deep Creek Maryland if anyone wants to stop up there for a drink on me! Connor took the Rainbow Generating Glasses. Box is dry and in good shape.

Just had time for a quick after work visit but definitly will come back to enjoy the park. Took a House Rewards keychain, left a lightup reindeer pen  only 76 shopping days left! 
  -  Found it. The cache is dry and in great shape. I really enjoyed the walk to this one. I ran into a young family on their first day of caching. Its always great to see kids enjoying outside activities with their parents. I used to hang out at this lake in the old days  late 70s . Back then it was called Bass Lake but all the partiers called it A Lake because of all the skinny dippers. We were thrown out by the Wake Co. deputies every week, but always came back. They could have put up a chain to keep us out, but I think the law enjoyed the view too much to make us quit. Good memories. I left some dog toys and took the deck of cards. p  last edit  9/29/2002 7 22 29 AM PST 
  -  Had some trouble with this one  our first day and getting tired .  Took a paddle boat break in between caches. p A lot more bush for this one than I expected and still getting acquainted with my GPSr.  Happened upon another cacher that was conveniently coming away from it, so we got some helpful tips.  It was practically under our noses.  My son couldnt make up his mind, but eventually took the dollar and left a stuffed McBunny. p  last edit  9/29/2002 7 56 16 PM PST

  -  Our first geocaching trip in about a year.  We were a little rusty but eventually found it.  We were almost trampled several times, cross country running season must be in full swing.

  -  Great little park.  Nice hike.  I didnt take or leave anything.
  -  Teaching my nephew the ins and outs of the GPS so I decided to hit this one again since its pretty easy.  I also wanted to drop off Steggy the travel bug since Id had him a while and I just wasnt sure I could get him to a cache hed like any time soon.  Drove him around in my car for a few days so hed think he was far from home ;  .    
  -  Somewhat easy spot. I would hate to have to use the toilet paper. Mosquitos were plentiful. I saw no snakes. There was a squirrel eating in the tree above me as I plundered the stash so I kept getting pelted with nut casings. Then I saw another couple of squirrels tearing trough the brush and chirping at one another. I would have like to stay longer but I had donated enough blood to the mosquitos and wanted to bug out. My fault for going in the evening with no DEET.  br I left my TRAVEL BUG Smiling Ichiro #308789. He will start his journey here.
  -  Along with newbie cacher Unca Bob and his faithful hound Daisy, we found this cache with no problem. Clever hiding place.  Where Im from in Texas we would use a pile of limestone rocks to achieve the same effect.  Took chocolate color rubber stamp pad, left a color plastic easter egg from the Cache as Cats Can cache nearby.  Last cache in North Carolina for now, enjoyed your state and several of your geocaches, now back home to Texas to cool off and nurse these deep mortal flesh wounds you would call Mosquito Bites.  You North Carolinians have got mosquitos that put Texas most vicious insect pests to shame.  Come visit Texas and just laugh at our evil fire ants, theyre nothing compared to the winged bloodthirsty vampires infesting your woods. p  last edit  8/10/2002 3 30 07 PM PST  p  This entry was edited by lowracer on Sunday, October 10, 2004 at 7 47 23 PM. 
  -  Thanks for a great cache. This was my first geocache find. It was a great location, easy spot for a beginner. Hot and humid, but thats NC in the summer. 
  -  Found this cache after a relatively short search around the area.  WARNING!  There was a copperhead snake resting just inches away from the cache today.  Fortunately my father in law spotted just as I was about to pick the cache up.  It slithered out of view without further incident, but I was a little shook up.  I dont know if copperheads tend to hang around the same place long, but I would reccommend keeping your eyes open for this one. p  last edit  7/23/2002 5 32 01 PM PST 
  -  Great day for a walk around the lake.  I hit this cache then made my way around to Cats.  Very warm day, but shade on the trail and a light breeze made it ok.  Took lip balm  my kid loves mint choc. chip ice cream  and left pepsi globe keychain.  Thanks!
  -  What fun!! My first cache find and what a blast it was.  I never knew the park was that big. Hiking in the woods made me realize more just how dry this summer has been   no water in the creek.  It rained as I was starting my search and that made it just interesting enough but I found myself repeating   I cant wait till Fall.  hot, humid, sticky, ticks, briars, and baseball pinging.  The cache was well hidden and a challenge to find but not too too difficult.  I took a key chain and left a deck of cards.
  -  Found it on or about 7/13/02 without incident, other than the mosquitos.  Thanks.
  -  This was our first Geocaching trip and our first find! We brought our dog, Matt, and really enjoyed the hike. Lost our signal, three times in the dense part of the woods, but we made it to the cache. Took a slinky  I love slinkys!  and left a ladybug beanie!
  -  Really easy walk to this cache. It isnt hidden too well.  p Took nothing but left a koozie. p Headed for another cache at Bond Park.
  -  Hurrah! This was my first Geocache find out of three attempts. Nice hiding job, fellas   I found it after Id been searching around the fallen trees for almost twenty minutes. I decided to take a break and sit down on one of the logs when I caught it out of the corner of my eye. Moooooooo!
  -  Walk right to within 100ft before things fell apart. I even walked along the top of the downed tree but didnt see it. It took me a good 20 min. to find it, I dont know what my problem was. As I was writing in the journal someone else came along and I was forced to either hide and make it as hard for them as it was for me, or stand up and say hello and give it away. Well, Im pretty friendly so... I stood up. I am real familiar with the area as I work at the High Ropes course at Bond Park. No excuse for it taking so long. I did have a lot of fun though. Dogman 98
  -  I took Hot Wheels car and left ships anchor novelty pen.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  My GPS acted up a bit in the woods, but found the cache without too much trouble. Took nothing, left nothing.
  -   A HREF http //www.jankout.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br Great first cache for BillyAndKak. We took our time about it, but after some poking around we finally found it. It was your average steamy July afternoon. I tried not to drip sweat on the logbook while Kak traded treasures. We took the rubber chicken keychain and the photo paper and left a Shrek action figure and a business card for a great jewelry store in the Bahamas. Thanks a bunch,  billy 
  -  Took the we people along for this one. Not hard to find   a great place to hike, canoe, etc.
  -  Loved it! Our first find  we havent even worked a GPS into the budget yet. Did it all with the hints, a topo map, determination and a little luck and sweat. Thanks for a great cache!
  -  Had found this one last year, but used it as a training mission for two new geocachers.  They got hooked and we went on to do 3 more today. p 
  -  Nice little park and cache. I stopped by with some newbies to geocaching. p Cheers! p Bugman
  -  TeamWOWs first find after a Fathers Day GPS gift.  Close to home and had a picnic while we were out there.  Took an Iron Giant toy and crayons and left gliders.  Love Bond Park and the kids LOVED fining a treasure!
  -  This was my first find....   Hurray...  I took some batteries and left a teachers apple pin..  This cache was 1/2 mile from my house and was an easy find......
  -  I got a GPS a couple of weeks ago and just found this site.  Walked out of the house at 8 10 to try to find my first cache  sunset at 8 30, mind you   what was I thinking!   But it was only about a mile away, I found it, left some Romanian money and batteries, and came home with Eeyore, muddy shoes, and a couple of bug bites.  Waitin for the poison ivy rash to show up ;  . p Thanks! br 
  -  First time geocaching with our friend GneissTuff&wacke.  It was really cool.  Thanks for the fun.
  -   img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle  Found this one just before sunset while introduced 4 friends to the thrill of Geocaching.  Etrex batteries ran out, so we relied on the topo map and the clue.  Thanks for the great cache.   p Left 4   still in package McD happy meal toys  2 Eeyors, 1 Rabbit, 1 blue jay teeny beany baby  and an ink stamp pad.   p Took the Smokey the bear bandana, very cool toy iguana, pepsi watch, police man action figure and a book.  The iguana will likely become a travel bug soon. 
  -  Beautiful day for a stroll through the park.  Libby loved the doggy beach.  The ducks were a little rattled though.  Great cache! Our eTrex played a few games with us but Kara prevailed. br The toilet paper was a great idea, but we opened the cache about 5 minutes too late for it to be of any use ;   p Walking through the creek bed we were able to get within 10 or 12 feet of a large grayish brown hawk  i  about a 3 wingspan  /i  sitting on a branch above and keeping an eye on us as we passed by below. Its probably a good thing we had just dropped Chester  i  the littlest mongrel  /i  off at home. p We took 11 cents in African coins and a deck of cards. We left behind a Magic card and an Iguana.   How do we hook this guy up with a travel bug anyway?  p Thanks for the fun, p  b Team Hatteras! /b  br Kara, Tom & Paul  i  plus just Libby this time  /i  p  last edit  6/10/2002 3 47 44 PM PST  p  last edit  6/10/2002 4 33 55 PM PST

  -  We found this one too easily.  Took the dollar coin left a Smokey Bear bandana.   p The Abbie Dogs 
  -  Great afternoon in Cary! Went to the REI store to look for a new ultralight pack, decided to geocache on the way home. p Nice park, really enjoyed it.

Left 2 South African coins, took an antibiotic polysporin packet. p Thanks for a fun hide Googalooga! p  last edit  5/26/2002 5 45 00 AM PST 
  -  The Buddy Brigade strikes again!  Bought a GPS yesterday...needed to test it out. Worked like a charm.  It took us right to the cache.  We went with some friends...theyll log in soon.  We took a pack of batteries and left a red compass. My son wanted the roll of TP, for some reason.  I said to leave that in case someone didnt plan ahead.

  -   A HREF http //www.wosto.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br My first cache! Picked this one because it was close to my house and easy for a first timer. I took the hard way in  not on the path , my Garmin GPS V was right on the money baby! Took a chik fil a Brain Teaser book  for my son  and left 3 $1 bills stamped with wheresgeorge.com  my other internet game . Noticed that there is an unintentional path being beaten to the cache, also watch out for the prickly vines, theyre plentiful! p Thanks! br Wosto
  -  Took our church teen group to Bond Park after church.  We borrowed a couple GPSs and made finding this geocache one of our activities.  The teens decided to split into two groups   boys against the girls.  I led the girls group and we found the cache without too much difficulty while the boys were wandering around about 100 yards away. p Our youth pastor took the car lamp that was in the cache and we left a 4 pack of AA batteries for someone elses GPS.  Also left some business cards if you feel like dropping in on a Sunday morning and visiting us. p Great cache to introduce beginners.  Our teens are hooked and we plan on trying the one at Jordan Lake for our activity next month!

Took nothing.. left a Cold Stone Cremery frequent buyer card with 2 out of 10 holes punched already.  Yummy. p  last edit  5/20/2002 5 18 53 AM PST 
  -  First cache my wife has joined my daughter and I on. GPS was right on and was within 3 feet.  Crossed the creek by accident but that just added to the excitement! Took the candy and two quarters. Left an eraser, stuffed animal and a lanyard key chain. Thanks for the hunt!
  -  Was in the area for a class, and the class was over at noon, so we got a day earlier start on Geocaching.  p Found at 2 00 Pm. br Enjoyed the hike.  Took a dollar and left a luggage tag and my sig. item.   Visiting from Richmond, Va 
  -  First cache! My daughter and I went out for a walk in the park and found this cache in a fairly short time.  It was well hidden when we found it and equally well hidden when we left.  All in all, a good time.  TN/LN.
  -  Had a great time! My 8 year old daughter and I trudged through the woods while my wife with her newly healed broken leg stayed on the trail. We flushed out a very healthy looking rabbit as we approached the cache. Great family outing. Weve lived in Cary Apex for three years and this was our first  though certainly not last  visit to Bond Park.
  -  My first cache.  Took my 4 year old daughter along.  She loved it.  Im hooked!
  -  10 35 AM  I was surprised to find a travel bug in this cache! Im visiting this area from my home in Oregon; since the travel bug  TBCDE  is trying to get to California, Ill have to help it get to the right coast, at least.  A stroke of luck, huh? Most travel bugs dont go across the country so quickly.  p I nearly didnt find the cache at all. I decoded the hint but I still couldnt figure out what it referred to. Finally, about to give up, I took one last look and found the well hidden box.  p I left a two dollar bill; since these dont circulate any longer, I hope that someone else will think its cool.  p Thanks for a fun hunt!
  -  Loved both the park and the cache.  Good job in keeping this accessible yet far enough off the beaten path.  Took me a while to find this one but it was fun.  Traded a compass for T Rex  mostly cause the cache was so full  and left Getting to Opa! travel bug.  This is a log book that is trying to make it to CA   I tried to make it obvious that its a bug and not the cache log. br Thanks for the fun and good luck to Opa.  p  last edit  6/5/2002 8 43 10 PM PST 
  -  Stopped to get a sandwich and then find this one at lunch.  Had a nice hike through the park. p Left an old fashioned toy car.  Took a furby that I may soon turn into a travel bug.
  -  Our 1st find!  First thing in the morning... Tim found it while Dad was staring at the GPS receiver.  There is a path becoming visible from the main trail to the cache.  Took the Mardi Gras necklace and flag pin, left a bouncy ball and breast cancer awareness pin.
  -  Found cache, not too difficult, my second the wifes first find.  Took nothing left nothing, interesting items in ammo box.
  -  16 30   This was my first find! My GPS kept losing its signal but I finally got to 0.02 miles and started looking around. I have to admit I peeked at the hint, otherwise I wouldnt have known what to look for. I took nothing and left a packet of Polysporin antibacterial ointment. p  last edit  4/4/2002 6 48 02 PM PST 
  -  Wife and I found the cache this afternoon.  What a pretty park.  Probably should stay longer.  We did take time to watch some ducks feed  bottoms up  in the lake.  Left a puzzle and took some insect repellant.  Number 9 for me.

The cache was really well hidden, we had to decrypt the clue to find it! Aaack. Took the gold coin and left a pack of playing cards. What a neat park. The trek was a lot of fun! Thanks! br 
  -  This was our third and last for the day.  Great park and nice trails. Thanks for the hide. Was lucky and took several pictures of raptor who liked posing. He was up in a tree in the middle of the woods and when we walked by the trail he flew over next to the trail and let me snap a few. Cache was in good shape. Took the spur keychain and left a Ford Truck. 
  -  I thought I logged this one back when I found it but somehow it does not appear on the page. Team Alex found this one. Took kids bracelet and left spur key chain. Nice park to visit.
  -  found it this morning.  Nice well stocked cache.  Enjoyed the hunt and the park.  Took the race car, left a frog pin, superball, and 3 oz saltwater sinker.  
  -  My first GEO Cache! I took only pictures. The golf ball suprised me as did the CDs.
  -  Yes, I found it this evening just before the park closed.  Once again, I was racing the darkness.  I really need to become an acrobat, with all this log crossing Ive been doing.  Just kidding.  This was a short walk.  Saw some kids biking through the woods.  I remember those days  When I moved here 3 years ago, I thought Id never find a park with a basketball court, but this geocaching thing has led me to more courts in the past week than Ive seen in some time. I took the Rusty Wallace travel bug and left a golf ball.  I think I have a good spot for it.  Thanks for the fun cache and another basketball court.
  -  This is our second Googalooga cache found.  Kathy actually found this one before I did.  We have decided to pick this as our starting point for the Rusty Wallace Travel Bug.  Rusty is in a race that will last all NASCAR season with 2 other Travel Bugs that are being released in Maryland and Florida.  Points are given for the number of caches visited, number of states traveled and various other items which will be detailed on the travel bug page.  This one was timed perfectly.  As we were getting out of the car MRN radio was announcing the starting line up for the Daytona 500.  Well lets help Rusty win this race by visiting as many caches, NASCAR tracks, and states as possible.  Thanks again Googalooga for the cache and the adventure.  Gooooooo RUSTY!!!  We left Rusty and took the Temporary tatoos.
  -   A HREF http //home.nc.rr.com/googalooga/geocaching.html target _blank Users web page /A  br Placed a new logbook in the cache today.  I took the old one home for some interesting reading.

  -  nice park, have passed it before and never stopped. p thanks for the cache! p team webfargo p 
  -   A HREF http //www.dannemarie.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br This was our first find. It was a good day for a walk in the park. There is a place in between the boat ramp and the volleyball courts where some dog owners let their dogs run around and play in the water. Ashe, our canine, enjoyed his play time with them enormously. p The cache was in good shape.. As others reported..  the log book is full but still useful. If I have time.. I will add another log book as this seems to be a popular cache.  We took the West Virginia Magnet and left a mini skateboard.  I am planning to go to Lake Tahoe in a few days.. if anyone has a Travel bug that needs a ride...  
  -   A HREF http //profile.sh/ target _blank Users web page /A  br This one was a quicky, for sure! br 
  -  Googalooga knows the good parks around town, thats for sure.  In the last two days Ive actually found that Cary does have some nice spots in it    Unfortunatly, I forgot to bring anything with me, so I didnt take anything either. p The log book is pretty much full at this point, you can find someplace to log if you flip around but the order to the log entries is gone.  Has anyone seen the Rope Trail in use?  That thing looks kinda interesting.
  -  Took a few minutes to find this one but finally did.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Signed the log and it was getting full.  Looked like people had started to use the back of the pages.
  -  Elizabeth and I  Tass  found this one after T and Kat told us about it.  It took us only about 30 minutes.  Elizabeth brought some springy bracelets and temp. tattoos and took the I spy game a pencil and a coin. Elizabeth  Kats neice  is now hooked and we all are looking forward to our next find!
  -  Loads of fun on our second geocaching.  Our first ended in nothing, so the kids were excited to finally find one.  Took the gooie hand, santa soap, golf ball and elephant pin.  Left a t shirt  Dont Make Me Get My Monkeys  and I Spy computer game. p The GeoHunters
  -  You know all the good parks! I really liked the paint job on this cache. I tromped around for about 15 minutes looking for a hollow tree to no avail and then resorted to whacking everthing with a stick. Finally found it  well hidden . I left a furby and took the now famous scooby whistle. Glad I beat the snow on this one...that would be a challenge! BTW, the LOG book is now full. br Thanks again, Revnine br 
  -   Today was a cache and Cary day.  Hannah and Googalooga.  This one was first. p As usual, I got excited and took off across country and could have followed a trail to a much closer point to enter the bush.  p I was standing on the log in question saying Look around guys, it says 10 ft.  My nephew found it at my feet.   We took a polished rock and a US flag key ring.  We left some bug repellant and a very nice silver elephant pin.  It was really neat to see a cache that had been around this long.  Thanks for the cache!!
  -  The log book is nearly full. We left some polished rocks and Star Wars cards.
  -  We didnt exactly pay attention to the part about this cache being very accessible.  We took the REALLY long way, and ended up crossing the creek on a log  Gore Tex is our friend!   Found the cache quickly, once we got on the right side of the creek.  The logbook is almost full.  We are impressed with how many visitors this cache has had.  We took a Christmas music CD, and left santa soap, chapstick, a WV magnet, and a lump of coal straight from WV.  This is a nice park, wish the ropes course was open.  Thanks for placing the cache. .......Botrytisfree and Erwinia br 
  -  I revisited this cache  the last time was Feb 10th  in hopes of trading for the Pearl Harbor DVD. Someone took it on Dec 26th, although they didnt log the visit on geocaching.com. That would have appreciated. Took nothing/left nothing. br P.S. The new cache container is nice, but I do miss the BEAR.
  -  THanks for all the fun.  Brought my 75 year old Uncle along and hear really had a good time.  It was his first time and he wants to go on more hunts.  Took nothing.   p Craig
  -  This was our first hunt   and find! Took about 2 1/2 hours. We parked on the opposite side of the park and went the hard way. It was in a great spot. Left a glow in the dark bracelet and an American flag keychain. Took the Pearl Harbor DVD and a New Testament Bible.  Our computer crashed so were just now able to log our find  01/14/02 . Sorry! Hope our mistake is a forgivible one! 
  -  I tried this one yesterday but failed. It pays to re read the clues before you go!  Tried this at lunchtime with DRAGON HEART. I knew exactly where it was this time. Took the t shirt  The Holy Grail of Triangle Geocaching. Thanks Googalooga! I will wear it proudly . I left a Pearl Harbor DVD.
  -   A HREF http //home.nc.rr.com/googalooga target _blank Users web page /A  br Checked on the cache hoping that the PS1 game would still be there  I first found out it was there when I watched the WB22, 10PM news a while ago! .  The game was there so I grabbed it.  In return I left a Googalooga geocaching T shirt  XL  and some other stuff.  Happy Trails.

  -  a beautiful 70 degree day in december !  to go finding our first cache.  took a frequent buyer card for global village java cafe and left a rocket scientist pin. br lots of fun, more trips planned over christmas break in FL and VA!
  -  Amy Hockert and Mark Spearin, from WB22, were interested in learning what geocaching was all about and they wanted to do it in two hours. The goal was to create a report to be aired tonight, on the 10 oclock news. This geocache, in Bond Park, was the best target I could think of. It is interesting in that it is hidden in the woods, yet is in a populated area. Also, I was pretty sure I could find it again. p Watch the WB22, 10PM news and see if we did a good job of representing geocaching and how much fun it is. p I took a keychain flashlight and left a flower pot.
  -  This is the first cache I have ever found.  I heard about this sport only last week while playing with my new Etrex Vista.  It was a great find!  I took an american flag patch and left a keychain and a pen.  The cache was covered nicely under some leaves.  I left it as I found it.  I cant wait until my daughter is old enough to enjoy the treasure hunt!  Hope to start my own cache soon. p Thanks,
  -  Woo Hoo!  p Sampson and I stumbled upon the lock box this afternoon and added a  br Playstation video game and a golf ball. I took a pack of glasses cleaning towels; a Susan b Anthony dollar and Sampson ate the dog biscuit. br 
  -  Great cache box! Had a good time! Dad, Mom, son  13  daughter  11 , daughters friend, and dog. p Took manicure set and whiste/yo yo bag. Left doggie boomarang, doggie treat and soccer keychain.
  -  This was our first! A great time! We took the calculator and swim goggles and left some kids software and a Tele Tubbie doll. Parker our five year old found the cache before the rest of us could.
  -  Very accessible and fun for the kids.  This was our first hunt with the two kids  5 and 6 .  We took the t shirt  for me , a bracelet, toy car and magnifying glass.  We left a squishy smiley face ball, a whistle, a yo yo and a platic spider  since we didnt see as many spiders today as we normally do !  Took about 5 10 minutes of searching before we found it.  This is probably the best cache  content wise  that we have found so far.
  -  Fourth of five for ScoobyGang today.  All started well, but then bagn getting mixed signals from the GPS.  Criss crossed the creek twice    assaulted by monster spiders    finally    could that be it??    YES!!  There, under the log!!  Took sunglasses  for the guys  and two rings  for the girls .  Left keychain and scooby whistle.
  -  Found this one on a perfect weather afternoon. Like others we had trouble deciding which side of the creek to search. The cache is still in good shape, except small holes have appeared in the container, which might let forest friends in. Good location, would have been great before the tree fell down. Took gold coins, left toy car and bracelet. Thanks for the adventure. br 
  -  Found this one fairly fast. One other visitor today as well. Good hiding place! Took nothing left nothing. Great day to be outside. br Poohbear
  -  found this one this am.  impressive park!  cache is in good condition and well hidden.  took nothing, left nothing.  thanks for the adventure.  harry
  -  I went to this cache several days ago, so My write up is from a weak memory.  After reading many of the log entries about not wanting to be on the wrong side of the creek...  I wound up on the wrong side of the creek.  I was able to find a downed tree across the creek and make a successful crossing without getting wet.  This was a pretty easy cache to find, and it is extremely full.  I removed the Sherlock Holmes diskette, and a kids meal toy  it took up way too much room , in there place I left 2 pairs of kids sunglasses.  The cache was in very good shape and the area is nice and clean.  I talked with the cache owner and got permission to remove the red towel that was left as a marker.  I think it looks kind of trashy.  Hopefully I will be able to return soon to get it out of there.  If someone else visits this cache before I can return please remove the towel.  All in all, it was a great cache even though I got drenched on the way out  rain not the creek .  Since I was already wet I decided to check out the Mulch Education area that I parked near.  Pretty nifty stuff if your into dirt.  Thanks again for another fun find Googalooga.  Great Hunting... Great Caching.  Gabchoud
  -  This was my first cache find also. I went with my two kids and a friend and his son. We had a little problem with the creek, didnt know which side of the creek the cache was hidden. After figuring out which side of the creek we should be on, we found it quite easily.  p We left a 3 1/2 disk containing 60 Sherlock Holmes stories, 2 friendship bracelets, and a WWJD eraser. p We took some gold coins, a golf ball, finger skateboard and a keychain. p Thanks br 
  -  Found this cache this evening  our first in North Carolina  after returning from a vacation in Pennsylvania  where we got hooked on Geocaching !  It was a quick find.  The jar was hidden off the trail in the woods behind a very large tree that had fallen over  maybe from Hurricane Fran?   Next to it was a dark red t shirt.  Didnt decode the hint, but noticed on the Googalooga web site that the bear jar was supposed to be in a hollow tree..?  We enjoyed the hunt just the same!  We saw an owl during our early evening hunt.  It was awesome!  The cache is jam packed with stuff.  We took Woody and the Cheerios car, and left a Pennsylvania key ring.  Thanks for taking the time to hide this cache.  Its great to have one so close!
  -  My first cache!  I read about this in the Raleigh N&O and was intrigued, bought a GPS through eBay for $54, and now Im hooked! p Since I live only a mile from Bond Park and Im a longtime orienteerer I thought this would be easy    Oh no!  Finally found the bear on my 3rd visit. p SPOILER INFO FOLLOWS  p Someone has left a bright red towel at the tree to help.  The downed tree is easier to see if you approach from the stream instead of the trail. p P.S. br You need a bigger bear!  Im afraid the scrunched glider will never fly.  Thanx again! br 
  -  I found this one Sunday afternoon 7.15.01. Real nice park. I lived in Cary for 5 years and passed this park at least a hundred times and never gave it a second thought as to checking it out. I will certainly be back. Left a scateboard I got at the Falls Lake cache and also left a dodge viper RT.
  -  Our first find!  Had been out on July 3 with my wife, and we couldnt find it...this time, we had a better idea where to look.  My nine year old took the Pokemon cards, and we left some toys.  A nice walk.
  -  My first geocache find!  Heavy canopy cover prevented my GPS from getting br good signals, but we did eventually find it.  I crossed creek twice looking. br We took work gloves and left a foil pack of Pokemon Fossil, 1st edition br playing/collector cards.   It had rained earlier and the foliage got me soaking br wet!  Great site and my 12 yo son thought that the outing was cool!
  -  Found this one  after trying to approach from the wrong side of the stream .  Good hiding spot in a popular park in Cary.  Almost didnt see it was dark and the blue top made it blend in with surroundings.  Took the fireworks and left leather work gloves  the slinky wouldnt fit through the jar .
  -   A HREF http //www.hwm.f2s.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br Much easier to find with the tree on the ground.  Couldnt see it while standing on the trunk though.
  -  Found this on 2nd try with Icvalue and Soaring Hawk.  
  -  Thanks for the update Googalooga!!  It was a big help. We were all around it on the fourth.  Eagle Eye II and Soaring Hawk and I approached it from the far side of the creek this time and shimmied across a log to get over the swollen creek.  We took a Mexican coin, a one dollar bill and a squishy red heart.  We left some belated fourth of July fireworks  NC legal  and some small kids toys.  Thanks for the adventure.  
  -   A HREF http //home.nc.rr.com/googalooga/geocaching.html target _blank Users web page /A  br ANOUNCEMENT! The googalooga cache at Bond Park is still there, but things have changed a bit.  Due to the inactivity I decided to go out there and take a look for myself.  Ran into “haywood” and company who were also looking for it.  The tall living tree with the hollow base has been blown down in a recent storm.  Kudos to haywood for reaching way deep into the nearly inaccessible hollow and finding the cache!  What a guy.  The cache is muddy but in great shape.  It has been replaced in the same spot but it is now visible and readily accessible.  Don’t be fooled by the upright tree with the hollow base that is right near the creek, that is not  and never has been  the cache location.  Happy trails.
  -  Great Hiding place.  My son and I crossed the creek several times before we spotted it.  Unfortunately, the cache was gone!  I stuck my arm in up to my shoulder in all directions, but found only cobwebs!  We still had a great time!
  -  Came, saw, found. Trying to log back caches. Took and left nothing.
  -  Found this one with Trailblazer and Geoscout. I really liked the container.
  -  Found this one with Geoscout and Pathfinder.
  -  My first time visiting Bond Park and Ive lived in Cary over three years. Go Figure?   I didnt realize this was such a great place, I plan to re visit in the near future.  Found the cache on Sunday, the Bear shaped jar was a cool touch.  Left three 1942 U.S. mercury dimes and took the toy chess set and a State Quarter.  Thanks.
  -  Again, what a great hunt. The children loved it. br We took a key chain and a dollar bill. We added br a dollar and a luck bracelet. We will be watching! br Thanks br 
  -  Went to Lake Wheeler this morning and decided to do this in the afternoon.  Took the Millers and had a blast.  Added a keychain with eye glass tools, but did not remove anything.  The hiding place was wonderful! 
  -  Cool Cache, and great Local. It was a nice, cool, wet bushes morning for me to find it and start my day off right. The area is a nice trip in the woods, watch the creeks. I have never been there before so I enjoyed it more. I removed nothing, but I left my traditional mini wooden chess set for those who may follow.  Tejas Native 
  -  Excellent hiding spot, I circled right by it on my first attempt  about two weeks ago  and I was looking right at it for about five minutes before I realized Id found it today.  I think I may have shoved the bear even farther up in the tree than it was before...  so look deep.
  -  We found your cache today. This was our first one. With all the leaves it was hard to get an accurate GPS signal. One minute we were 30 feet away, then we were 75 feet. There are a number of locations in the immediate area. We found a few possible locations for the cache. One, however, had a very, very, very large ugly spider in it. We took an airplane, a keychain, and a light, swapped $1 bills and left a glue stick and an army man.
  -  Saw the dollar bill and keychain; so we must have been just after Racoon.  This was our first find and a great introduction to the sport.  Didnt see any snakes, but we were looking.  Took an airplane; left a North Carolina quarter.
  -  Our second find and what a nice location! My daughter and I had taken  Mrs. Racoon and momma br racoon to the Airport and enjoyed the quick find br We were short on time so the easy access was great. This was our best yet. We found the umstead park cache just after the rangers had removed the actual cache so this was our first br physical find  a ranger business card at the other We were short on cache materials but left a key chain and a dollar bill. Thanks for your effort and great location!  
  -  A couple of my buds and I found our first cache today!  It was an awesome day an we had not a clue what we were doing.  But we found it and spent a nice day at the park.  Took some batteries and a knfir of sorts.  Towards the end of the summer look out for a cache hidden by me and the rest of the Duke field hockey team!!!  
  -  Actually visited and found this cache back on 4 8, but never logged the visit.  This was our first geocache, my wife, friend and his wife all had a blast!  Took some circling around, crawling across logs over the creek, and coming back, but finally found it.  Didnt take anything, but we left a little black penlight. 
  -  I actually got my wife to go with me on my first cache hunt!  From my front door the GPS reported I only had .53 miles to get to the cache.  I had wrongly assumed what part of the park it would be in and the gps quickly informed me of my error.  Adjusted course and located the cache fairly quickly.  Took a little Donald Duck to remember my first cache by and left a watchband compass and some AA batteries. p Tim
  -  Found it today with Daddy, Mr Alan, and Dana. We saw a really big snake. Took a globe ball  Geoball , and left some toys. Thanks! br #1 Son
  -  Went back with my buddy and 2 of our kids. They used the GPS and a compass to find the cache. They were so proud and excited. My son took the Geocache art globe, left several items. My buddy will log the visit soon, he has ideas for a few stashes of our own. Saw a 3 1/2 foot king snake near the cache, we nearly scared it to death crashing through the woods! Thanks again, Googalooga! Three more Geocachers added to the sport today!
  -  My first cache! Nice hiding spot, would be kind of scary to reach into in warmer weather. I didnt take anything, left a Mardi Gras coin, a cellphone style calculator, and a sticker. Once I figured out how to use my new toy, it took me to about 20 feet from the cache. I was impressed, as the sky was pretty cloudy, and a fair number of trees. Thanks, Googalooga!
  -   A HREF http //www.carolinaredclay.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br We circled around once and closed in. It was easy to find once we left the trail.
  -  We ate cheeseburgers while we looked for it.
  -  Once again, Went with Matt, and found this one.  Much easier than the first one today  Jordan Lake .  A rainy day, but fun as heck.  Fantastic hiding spot.  Didnt want to stick my hand in there, but did.
  -   A HREF http //www.mindspring.com/~replay target _blank Users web page /A  br Found it!  In addition to this Most Perfect hiding place, there is another Nearly Perfect hiding place.  So, if you thought you found it but didnt, then keep looking!  This is a great cache to hunt if you want a short walk is a nice park.  Left an original geocache globe.  Enjoyed it, thanks!
  -  A beautiful day! Enjoyed the weather, a dad w/ kids launching model rocket powered UFO, and a couple flying a kite on the way to your cache. I plan to take my daughter and her best friend back to Bond Lake on Sunday, as she is expressing interest in the adventure. Thatll be great.
  -  This was my first cache! Nice spot and a beautiful day for a short hike in the woods.

  comments: 
  -  Grabbed this one after work. Quite a few muggles around the area. I had to sit in my car for nearly 20 minutes to wait them out. Finally they left and I made my move. TFTHSL. 
  -  Thank goodness for gardeners.  SL, Thanks,
  -  Found during a quick lunch stop.  Except for the bathing beauty, no one else was around.  SL and TFTH!
  -  It is allways ez at 7 00 in the morning everone was sleepn . br Wish I had some firecrackers to wake them up..lol br Allthatnme br Nick Jenn
  -  Found this one on a downtown raleigh run before the heat got to me. TFTC SL. 
  -  Thanks to Dash9, I was more successful this time.  I guess we should have looked a little harder for alternative locations.  Thanks for the hide!!
  -  after riding in circles I spotted it. log was wet os I did a quick dry on the hood. replaced the bag. doc was in town. TFTC SL
  -  I was really off when I started thinking about where this one was going to be... When the GPS kept pointing further and further, the lightbulb came on and we knew we were hot. p Great cache. p  SL
  -  The cache wasnt where the owner had originally placed it. I managed to locate it an replaced it where it was supposed to be. Once I found the cache container, it was obvious where it was supposed to be. Anyway, the log was rather wet, but at least folks should be able to find this one quickly now.
  -  Hmmm.  Felt pretty sure we knew where wed find this but came up empty.  We werent bashful as we tried every possible nook and cranny we could find   but   nope, not this time!!
  -  24th of many with Geologygirl on tour of area. TFTH/SL.
  -  Thanks for the quick park and grab.  Out caching with Billwolf1 and USMC2052 today.  SL  TFTH
  -  found it with the gang. nice hided
  -  Found this one while out caching today with USMC2052 and JGH Team.  Took the RBC pin and left a del Sol ring.  TFTH
  -  First of the day, thanks for starting us off with a find!
  -  First of Twelve Finds for Handy Find & me today.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  Enjoyed the hunt for my first micro.SL
  -  Found it! Wow, without the hint I dont think I would have found it. Great hint! br Talk about high risk   I think there were about a half dozen folks watching me as I stumbled around looking for it   a bit embarrasing for a newbie such as myself. p I left it out in the sun to dry for a few minutes before replacing it.
  -  The last one of the day    the kids went crazy over this one.  Grandson found $1 in it.  We didnt have small things so left a hair clip.  Happy New Year!
  -  A Little late logging but found with GRANPA ALEX.Thanks for the cache. p rldill
  -  Thanks for a nice cache . . . a quick grab is nice in a city of micros.  br Granpa Alex
  -  Nice hide, would never know it was there unless you knew what you were looking for.  It was dark out when I went and it was still easy to find. Log is still wet and smells bad too. ;  
  -  Another great lunchtime cache! The log is a little soggy but not ruined. You might want to remove the top few pages and replace the bag.
  -  Quick find.  The place was dead on a cold day like today.  Dumped the water out of the cache container.  Cheers.
  -  Found this one on return from mountains. Nice hide.SL,TFTH. br  hbohill,Jean & Binky dog person

  -  Easier in the daytime, and the thunder shower cleared the area out.
  -  found with TKMac and lindsychris.  we used to stay here, so it was nice to come back for a visit!
  -  Quickly found this one while caching with LindsyChris and Velkie.  Great location! br TKMac
  -  Found today with TKMac and Velkie.  Great area for us, we used to stay nearby when visiting KMac. p Great way to hide the cache!
  -  Since we couldnt  make it to Summer Fun we were determined to cache at least once between commitments. This was once was perfect! It was at dusk and somebodys kids were raising a ruckus nearby...which provided great cover for us to locate and grab the cache. The log was just a tiny bit damp when we opened it. I repackaged it carefully...but there might be a mildew problem down the road.
  -  I like this one....find ##99!! Wahoo! br 
  -  Found it right before a meeting.  After locating the cache I removed it and took it to the truck to sign the log.  When I went to replace the cache a guy was standing inside the adjacent area.  I told him that I was reading something.  He kept watching me so I turned around and walked off with the cache in hand.  The guy set up shop in the area and kept watching me.  So I left and took the cache with me.   br After my meeting I went back and replaced the cache.  Therefore the cache was technically missing from about 7 15 pm to 9 00 pm.  I apologize to anyone who may have been hunting for it during that time but I thought it would be better do this than have the cache muggled.
  -  This cache is much easier at night, although I still felt a little suspicious.  I looked for 5 minutes or so before finding the cache, and then made ghost before the cops got called/showed up.  
  -  1 50   Found with Penguincacher.  We figured out the location in no time but certainly felt the watchful eyes... managed for Penguincacher to make a quick grab so we could get back to the car.  We were in and out on this one very quickly. br TNLNSL
  -  Found today with Gecko757.  Figured out where it was, but felt like all eyes were on me.  Wondered if someone thought I was up to no good.  Grabbed it, went back to the car to log, and quickly put it back and high tailed it out of there.  On our way home to Virginia.  After a weekend of very interesting micros, we will certainly be throwing a monkey wrench into the caching community in Hampton Roads. Thanks for another great cache.  TNLNSL
  -  DrFred and I must be on the same caching schedule. We endured the cleaners occasional evil eye while searching, and DrFred located the cache.
  -  Ran into miscmayhem for a second time while looking for this one.  It took a few minutes, but we eventually found it.  Thanks for the hide!
  -  Red Wolf was disappointed   still no bikinis.  Granddaughter found very quickly.  SL
  -  This was your toughest yet.  But we found it none the less.  Thanks very much.  TNLN
  -  Found this on my way to work at 6 00am, cant get more discreet than that. Nice hide!  SL
  -  Just noticed this was back up, so Ken went and found it on the way home from work. These Paintfiction micros make good night finds. TNLNSL   thanks for the cache!
  -  Unarchived.
  -  The log is high and dry.  Go check it out!  No bikinis around there this time of year though...
  -  Archived until owner can retrieve/replace log. p honeychile  admin  br geocaching.com
  -  I was in Raleigh from Florence SC on business.  Thought Id do some hunts. p Whew, high risk, Ill say..... Lots of people around the pool.  Awesome hide.  I cant believe no ones found this one.   p Log and cache is soaked.  Didnt sign it but did take a picture. p Thanks for the hunt and thanks Raleigh for all the great caches.   p 
  -  Found it, couldnt sign it. p Did some acting, took a tape measure, dozens of pix of the cache, crawled around taking notes, yelled numbers at the wife, had a great time.  Folks watched us for a bit, we kept up at it, they got bored, we got the stash. p Then couldnt sign it.   EWWWWW! p 2nd of the Raleigh Short Roundup. p Pix available for the owner for proof if so desired. p Owner is now in Florida per his registration page.  Can a Raleigh Resident Cacher please adopt this cache or at least replace the log?  Thanks. p  edited for umbrage. 
  -   A HREF http //www.markrebuck.com/ target _blank Users web page /A  br Easy find.  Absolutely perfect coordinates!  As JoeyBob mentioned, the log was totally soaked.  I didnt even try to pull it out because it was so sodden   \. p Got some really strange looks from a mother/son who were nearby. p  MarkRebuck,   a href http //www.markrebuck.com/ target _blank visit link /a   
  -  Like others have said, out in plain sight. Found this one as the sun was starting to come up, so not many onlookers. The log is a sodden mass of paper, and cannot be written on. Emptied as much water as I could, left the game token in the cache. TLC is required from the owner! br JoeyBob
  -  Found it!  My second paintfiction cache for today.  In Raleigh from South Carolina.  TNLNSL.  Thanks for the cache!
  -  Just like the man said!  Right there    once you find it, you cant miss it!  Thanks for the fun.  JuneFlowers
  -   img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle  Found at 8 20pm p In town for a few days of business and decided to visit a few micros ... the GPSr gave this one away too quickly.  Thanks for the hunt. p 
  -  Whoa!  Found this after a few minutes.  My first attempt at one of the Paintfiction caches.  Sure was nervous looking around and not wanting to be spotted.  Thanks for the neat ideas!  Signed log, TNLN.
  -  2nd urban effort and great fun   Lots of nice scenery here and cache is not hard to spot   Its amazing how people ignore folks with clipboards who look as if they know what theyre doing   Log is still soaking wet so I left mine on another piece of paper which is no doubt wet by now   Thanx for the fun   Ponder br 
  -  Thanks for the hunt. Log Book VERY wet, could not write in it. Needs to be replaced.
  -  A great cache!  The overcast day made it difficult for my GPS 15 to average the satellites, and making for a challenging find.  I couldnt believe how much in plain sight it is.  The log is VERY wet... left a 5 Yen coin, believed to be good luck. p Frozen Monkey + 2.
  -  If it were a snake it would have bite me.  This is not a hint.   It is incredibly visible!  p  last edit  7/1/2003 10 30 47 PM PST 
  -   A HREF http //toadstool.sh/ target _blank Users web page /A  br Did this one with Sallad. 
  -  Finally found this today.  I saw it when I walked up.  I had a feeling of where it was but was nervous about someone wondering what I was doing.  Logs are getting really soggy.
  -  Got this on my second try.  Too many bikinis to concentrate my first time.
  -  Found w/CCCA. Thanks for a fun find!  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle  p {logged in as TheREALBug}
  -  You guys certainly have GUTS down here!  WOW so close to so many people & oddly enough, nobody seems to care!  LOVED IT!  #9 of the morning still on the way to Flag Day@Durant Park.
  -  Second micro of four today. A passer by wanted to know if he could help with whatever it was that I was doing. I told him that my wife had dropped a favorite earring and I thought I could find it myself. He moved on without further comment. The cache is in good condition and IS plainly visable. Wow!
  -  I stopped by this one on my way to a meeting and my GPS even had under a foot as the distance.  I didnt see anything and I felt a little nervous being on private property, there was an older couple looking at me, so I left.  I have to go by there in a couple weeks for another meeting so Ill try again.
  -  Third of three PF micro finds tonight. This one is really out in the open. Enjoyed some nice scenery while on the hunt too.
  -  I thought since Paintfiction was flooding the area with micros, the least i could do was try to find them. I went out of order, but this was my first micro. So far 3 out of 4. I left a Susan B Anthony coin.
  -  This cache placement deserves the GUTS award. Definitely in plain sight, but should remain unmolested due to the surroundings. There were plenty of muggles coming and going, but they all wseemed to have better things to do than pay us any attention. TNLN and thanks for the fun.
  -  logging
  -  This one was cool, I was wolking by it over and over, and the gps was going crazy but Jarocha came to the rescue and fund it. Tks. 4 the fun.
  -  First find.  Not too easy, not too difficult.  Great fun.  Took a bullet key ring, left a cut gemstone.
  -  Took nothing br Left trade mark key ring
  -  Great hiding spot. My first micro cache. Took nothing and left nothing. Just signed the log.

Dont bother trying that future cachers!
  -  First find at 10 30am.  There were actually two people enjoying?? the cool weather in the area.  Wasnt sure if they were cacher owners or muggles, so I just cached and dashed.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  2nd finder. br Welcome to the area!  Look forward to meeting you at an event and finding more of your future caches.  br Got this one after finding the reincarnation of Snicket.

  -  Very little bushwacking was needed to get to this one. The construction in the area just provides a minor obstacle that can easily be avoided. The Little Cachette took something and left something but not sure what! Thanks for the cache.

  -  The cache is still there and chock full of happy meal toys. The kids were very excited to do this cache  re  happy meal toys  but it is not appropriate for young  or whiney  children now.   p The construction has blocked off the paved path and the moderate walk has changed to a 500 ft bushwack through thick underbrush.  Considering I had to use some cattails as stepping stones this cache will probably be very difficult to get to if it ever rains.   p T  Happy meal toys and ticks  shudder  L  Happy meal toys
  -  Was out at this park today caching & my friend & she was going to do this one   I already did in the spring  however a ton of new land clearing was going on today for more fields for USA baseball in the very same area as the cache spot . Huge possibility that the cache might have been bull dozed away!
  -  M found this one quickly.  Nice hide.  TNLNSL.
  -  Nifty location. Im I took the hard way, bushwacking about 600 feet, but it was fun anyway. TNLN
  -  Yay! My 100th cache. Surreal location for a cache. I enjoyed it.
  -  Some serious bushwacking, thorns, and ticks.  Found it with Reward.  Left Bee ads, took pinwheel.
  -  Theres a park?  And a trail? p Hm... p We came in from the Green Hope School  ?  road and walked the gravel road until I cut through the brush. p Left the kids out on the road...  Lots of bugs and itchy things in there today! br 
  -  TFTC.
  -  What fun! We were at the park for daughter #1s softball clinic, so this made a nice diversion. 3 hours of watching little girls chase balls through a field is a little much. Trail was a little mucky today, but not too bad. Took Spongebob Travel Bug, left Incredibles disk shooter. SL
  -  Hurray!  We have the whole clan here searching for this cache, Billwolf1, USMC2052 and JGH Team joined us at the park.  Found this one just after hearing about the Popes death on NPR.  TNLNSL  TFTH
  -  Was out with the whole family, found this cache TFTH/TNLNSL. Watch out for ticks, they are out now.

  -  TFTC SL TNLN nice little hike great spot
  -  Very nice park.  You feel like you have passed through 4 or 5 eco zones on the short hike to this cache.  We left the Sponge Bob travel bug, a mini wooden tumble tower  like Jenga , and a Zoe  Elmos friend on Sesame Street kids meal toy.  We took the wooden puzzle left by Hex the Kiwi and a mini frizbee with and easter bunny in it. p  This entry was edited by LEDZ and Orange Boy on Sunday, March 27, 2005 at 6 33 16 PM.

  -  Nice little walk to this cache.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  Stopped by so jklGoDuke could pick up the smoochy TB for our upcoming trip to MO.  I grabbed a windup boat toy and we left  a helicopter and a lizard.  I think we found an easier way in and out this time, although it may have just been the season.  TFTC   again!
  -  This was a quick park and grab.  We had a great time on a nice mild winter day. p Left a small baseball helmet, took a Jaffar toy. p Thanks for the fun find!
  -  This was a neat location.  Scruffy found it to be a nice place to lay down and relax.  We needed to eventually rely on our eyes in order to locate the cach.  Thanks for the hide!!
  -  We found this one today with the help of our dog Bailey.  He sniffed it out for us!  Left Smoochy Smoochy Travel Bug.  Also left a Snoopy stuffed animal.  Took the Penguin car.  Too much fun...
  -  This was a easy find and was much needed after all the micros earlier in the day, we came in from the back side which was a much shorter route. Cache was in good shape. br Thanks br rldill & JO_JO
  -  Thanks for a nice cache . . . came in the back way for a great time and distance reduction   good cache, nice hide   ya done good! br Granpa Alex
  -  I went in the looooonnnnggg way to this one. On the way out I found the way which involves less bushwacking. Nice & dry despite all the recent rain. Good cache   thanks! TNLNSL.
  -  3rd time is the charm, apparently... or maybe it was the fact that i didnt bring my two year old.  Shes not a fan of the thick woods you have to go through to get to this one.  I saw a cool flower on the way in.  Ill post a picture and maybe someone can tell me what it is.  While i was signing the log, i heard a snort and looked up to see a deer about 30 feet off, running away.  I must have missed it  and it me  on the way in.  Took a little fairy with flappy wings and left a MicroPet that looks kind of like a panda.
  -  Came out here after playing in the sand and the big tunnel slide with little 1100101.  She was agreeable enough at first  find a toy... in a hole... i get to pick... find something...   but about the time we got right on top of it  according to the GPS  she had had enough  go home, my house .  I looked around for a minute or two, but had to give it up.  Alas... another day.  We did see a deer jump across the road, though.
  -  cool cache br out bobblehead,horse br in  tinkerbell, sieve br in/out Blueberry TB br Thanks for the smiley! br Rixart Huluvu,Emilymaus
  -  Found this one with my almost 3 year old son while my wife  jklGoDuke  was out at a caving meeting.  Had a bit of trouble because we didnt bring a good compass.  Finally stumbled upon the cache.  Son took a small car and I grabbed a mini lighthouse.  Left a pinwheel and a small orange scooter.  The Allen Iverson TB also made a brief appearance as its traveling with me this week.
  -  Nice cache . . . loaded with goodins & clean   THANKS br Granpa Alex
  -  On the way in thought the briars were bad, but on the way out found that the ticks were even worse!  Found it anyway and did a little trading including a Shrek 2 Puss in Boots toy from BK on the way to the park.   The third of six finds today.
  -  It was hot today and in work clothes not too fun.  Thanks anyway for a relatively quick find.  The cache was completely uncovered   hid back appropriately before leaving.
  -  Found with jklGoDuke.  Now I have an account of my own!
  -  Very nice park   ended up sitting in the car for a while while my son finished his nap, then we went after the cache.  I should know better than to try geocaching with shorts on   those pretty white flowers have thorns!  My son was delighted by all of the toys in the cache, and finally chose a King Mickey Mouse windup toy.  I grabbed a tiny green mug.  We left Snow white and a little green flute.  Caught a tick walking across my lap, so we made tracks back to the car.  CITO!
  -  First of the day for us, nice park, easy walk.  Took Chancy and a toy car, left two replacement toys and an Iraqi 5 Dinar bill.  Would the next finder please write RubiconRob, 28 Mar 04 on it?  I forgot and would like to see where it turns up.  Thanks.  The picture is a semi spoiler so dont look if it spoilers bother you. p RR, SigO, and the LittleJeepers
  -  We found this one at about noon.  Neat cache in a nice place.  I concealed it a little better.  The snow must have pushed the concealment aside.  TNLNSL.  Thanks very much
  -  Nice area. Wouldnt want to know what the ticks are like in the summer  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle 
  -  Red Wolf Team   12 31 03    12 30 pm br This was a good hide in a very nice park. Enjoyed it. br Took 2 coins and left 2 Red Wolf geo badges. Thanks br for the hunt and the fun.
  -  This was a great place for a hunt.  It was quite dense as we got closer.  The kids had a great time playing with all the toys.  We took the 3D game and lighted toy.  Left the Pokemon compass and Santa.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  Densely packed forest and thorns thorns thorns make this one interesting to get to. Lots of toys.  Liked the location.  Took carbiner and left bottle opener. SL. br 
  -  Neat hiding spot.. Still a few sticker bushes, ouch!.

  -  Found it. Had to do some bushwacking to get to it. Godzilla Jr. did not like the dense area. Lots of stickers and stuff.  p TN/LN/SL p Mothra
  -  Happy Happy #75 for The Alethiometrists! This was a pretty quick find   only about 150 feet of off trail, and a geo trail is starting to form along that part  though do be careful of a few thorns . The actual cache area is very nice, with many small pines. Amelia found the cache itself. We came for Kalis Key to My Heart travel bug, which we were happy to find. We meant to bring a Happy Meal toy, but left it in the car, so instead we left $2 in Canadian coins   a loonie and four Canadian quarters. Also left an Alethiometrists bag tag. Thanks for the cache!
  -   A HREF http //toadstool.sh/ target _blank Users web page /A  br I came to this cache a few weeks ago after work, and was surprised by the thick brush. I was wandering for about 25 minutes in my nice dress clothing for work, getting some minor holes in my slacks. During which, I struck myself in the eye. I searched on for another 5 minutes with one hand  over my eye, and then conceded defeat.  I was embarrassed, knowing that several people used this cache as their very first geocache and found it without issue. My eye was in pain for the rest of the evening. p So, I came back friday from work. This time, I was wearing jeans, and had no plans to poke my eye out. I told myself  Not only am I going to do this, but Im going to do it without a GPS, since I knew I was in the right area. I set a timer, and jogged from my car, to the cache, finding the cache within 2 minutes, logging myself, and jogging back. Elapsed time  10m3s.  p Revenge. Thanks for the fun!  p 
  -  Parked pretty close by and only bushwacked in the final 120 feet.  Nice easy find.  TNLN.  I think I must have come in from the backside, I never saw a park.  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle   Nice hide. p NCTreker
  -  We were the only ones in the park.  We walked the paved service road and bushwhacked a short distance.  Left Kalis Key to My Heart TB.
  -   A HREF http //www.ibiblio.org/sallad/gallery/geocache target _blank Users web page /A  br I took my friend out for his first cache to this one.  We had some trouble at first but finally found it.  We found some ticks and the grass is getting pretty packed down from the trail to the cache.
  -  Found it this evening ... didnt realize this park was there.  Well hidden... starting to get weedy.  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  I returned with my friend Dave.  This was Daves first cache and I let him do everything. p I also returned because I took a toy last time and didnt put a toy in.  I left a Star Wars Let the force decide top.  Its like a magic 8 ball but you spin it and the answer lights up and it plays music. p Thanks. p Chris
  -   A HREF http //wolfhusky.org/ target _blank Users web page /A  br What a great day for a walk! Were learning that part of the trick to navigating by GPS is to guess where the path turns ahead of you and when its time to go bushwacking through the woods. Found this one without too many problem. Took Lion King figurine, left dog figurine.  Thats a very cool Stitch bobble head in there, too, but I didnt have anything with me to swap for that one... 
  -  Great spot.  I had too make it a little more difficult so I hiked through the briars.  Took the path on the way out though! TN/LN
  -  Yea, its spring again. I love to cache on the motorcycle, you already have long pants and boots on. Driving on some semi country back roads in 70 weather is great. When I turned into the park I thought I was back at the Ball & Chain cache. Some of these Cary parks look the same, very nice. I found the cache in good shape but it did take a little while, there are thousands of mounds of pine straw everywhere with no knowing if the cache was even in any of them. I left the happy couple and took the TB and the doodle art set for Boys and their toys.
  -  Coordinates right on  again.   Nice sports complex.  Cary does seem to have the neatest parks around.  We took a Samuri Jack toy and left Doodle pen top.  We also dropped off Sammy the Sailfish TB   he wants to head to salt water.  Thanx for the hunt! p Jeff, Traci, Wes and Sid br The Davis Family
  -  I found this cache this afternoon.  This was both my first cache and my fathers first cache.  My father is from Torrington, CT and I am right down the street in Cary Park. p This cache was in good shape, nothing was wet.  We took a daisy duck toy, but did not have a toy to give, so left some money.  I will probably return with a toy next time. p This was great!
  -   A HREF http //duffie.org/ target _blank Users web page /A  br What fun.  This was our first cache and it was a good challenge.  That box was LOADED with stuff.   p  br 
  -  Found this one but forgot to log it until 5/4.
  -  very nice spot, hard to be seen from trail, grassland should cut down on trail formation.  Nice new park. Cache is very well stocked, and well hidden.  Took Baloo toy, left Simba bobblehead, mini frisbee, green mug, and a Fishingfools bag tag.  Thanks for the hunt, p Fishingfools 
  -  Neat park. Lots of frogs singing. Left Daisey Duck, took hot wheels car.
  -  Interesting area, TNLN
  -  Nice park.  My sons have had soccer games here in the past.  Easy walk and find.  The frogs were really making lots of noise!  br TNLN. Thanks for the hunt.
  -  Nice park, nice short hike, my wife walked right to it! TNLN. A beautiful day in the park! Thanks for providing a fun outing.  Mybrothersonlybrother and wife
  -   br Found this one via the quick way in. Well stocked cache and hidden in a nice area. Coordinates are great. p TN/LN p Thanks for the hunt! br 
  -   Third find on a beautiful afternoon. Found it pretty quickly once I got into the area.  Resist the urge to go bushwacking until the last moment.  This is one of the best stocked caches I have ever seen; the drive in must love you guys.  Left a Hot Wheels Geo Blaster  still in its wrapper  and took a Chipmunks Cable Car. I think it will become my next travel bug. 
  -   Very well hidden.  I searched for over an hour for this one.  The pines make the GPS go a little crazy, but it looks like the coordinates were close once I got a good siginal.  Left a wheres george, and took a little toy.  OH YEAH, ANOTHER FIRST  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_cool.gif border 0 align middle .   Theres another way in that doesnt require you to go through the park, but the park is nice. p  last edit  3/4/2003 9 33 02 AM PST  p  last edit  3/4/2003 9 33 21 AM PST

  comments: 
  -  Went with dewpoint52 expecting a park and grab, but it took us a while, and soon it got too dark to see. We saw many trees with the characteristics stated in the additional hint, but apparently we were looking in the wrong areas. br  The trail was really pretty, though, and even though we didnt find it, we still had fun. I ran into several spider webs; none of which appeared to have spiders on them, so thats a plus  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle .  br  Ill have to try again later   maybe around lunchtime instead of dusk  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_clown.gif border 0 align middle .

  -  #10 of the day for our Cary Caching Marathon... p Cool park.  Never knew it was there. p SL   TFTH
  -  Cache owner has not logged on in three months, but hopefully still reads the e mails notifying of a cache find.  I enjoyed finding the cache, and thank the owner for placing it.  However the cache does need maintenance.  The log book is full, the pen is empty, the cover of the container is cracked, though not yet leaking.  Thanks!  ~erik~
  -  In the Cary area and picked up a few caches as well.  Thanks for the hunt.  tnln sl
  -  This was a nice fun cache to find.  Wish more were like this.  Good job!  TNLNSL
  -  The five helpers we had really were great. It was their first geocache and they liked it. They really were excited when they found the container.
  -  GPSr was bouncing around taking me everywhere but the cache. br Finally saw something about 50ft away that made me think Hmmm. TNLN SL. Thanks for the hide.
  -   img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle first find. just looking. tried to sign the log but the pen ran out of ink. p thanks & have fun.
  -  Enjoyed my finding my first cache.
  -  Nice cache near a couple of nice parks. The log book is full...we added a page so we could sign it. The Little Cachette took a game and left a puzzle. Thanks for the cache.
  -  This was my very first find.  Im hooked. TNLNSL
  -  Quick find. Thanks for the adventure!
  -  A nice stroll along the greenway before it got too hot today.  My son enjoyed the playground afterwards.  Boy what a lot of construction going on in the vicinity.  Took Dream Bike TB and left a sugar bear  put in canister to keep sugar fresh and not clumpy .  TFTH
  -  Quick find today while out for lunch.  TNSL.  Left the Dream Bike TB for a future finder.  Cache was uncovered so I recovered it with local materials to make it less visible from the trail.
  -   STRONG N 35° 48.000 W 078° 47.433 /STRONG  br Was on my way to the new Lowes after work, so thought Id take 15 minutes and try to find this one. Just like HandyFind, my GPSr pointed me into the closed off area. I decided to search some and found the cache within 10 minutes. Im guessing that it has been moved from its original location, so I took some new avg coordinates of where I found the cache with my 60CS. br I put an Activision Grand Prix handheld race game into the cache and took a green lantern figure. Nice cache Casey! TFTH! 
  -  I tried to go for this one after winning my match today, but the trail that my GPSr took me to is now closed off with orange fences, and there are very large pine trees that were just cut, laying all over the trail making them impassable.
  -  So, once again were out in the waning daylight with no information on the caches we intend to find other than, you know, the waypoint and GC #s as GSAK downloads them. p Duh. p JustMike mentioned Well, theres a Regular 1/1.5 2.9 miles away.  Cant be too tough, right? p Heh. p Autoroute dumped us at the end of some cul de sac in a high brown hood where every third house seemed to be occupied... and quite nicely so.  No sounds of Deliverance playing in the background here.  But, by this time, were far away from the suburbanesque lights and its dark.  Like, way dark.  But were, maybe, 420 away. p JustMike suggests, Well, we could walk through the backyard of one of the unoccupied houses. p With a very crappy flashlight.  With a 5yo in tow.  Down a ravine.  In the dark? p Not yet willing to give up, we realized the shopping complex next door was well lit and decided to head over in that direction to see what it might bring.  One nice catch basin very smartly fenced off in the direction of the cache of course.  However, we could see the skate park just beyond the mire and figured wed give that a try. p Lo and behold, as we pulled into the park parking lot, the ge ometer ran down to only a couple hundred feet from where we were.  Phew.  We were on the right track, which, after all of these recent half assed find attempts and logging DNFs is a good thing, you know? p So there are only about 20 guys playing basketball and another dozen at the skate park. p We are two adults and one 5yo, walking between both well lit courts.  Heading into the dark forest.  Yeah, Im pretty sure we looked like tards. p As we get halfway there, the 5yo pipes up and says rather smartly, I left the flashlight in the car. p Goody! p Surely this 1/1.5 wont be tough enough to find that we have to go back and get the flashlight, right?  Were ONLY 116 away! p Into the woods we go.  JustMike had the GPSr, and RealityChecks hand. p I had the cell phone. p What was I going to do?  Call someone and weep?  Dial 911?  Call a geo lifeline?  Get someone on the west coast to read me hints or cache logs?
  -  None of the above!  I was gonna use that dim 1 x 1 screen, dammit, to search for that box under all of those fallen trees and leaves! p Well, that was the plan, anyway. p JM gestures around to tell me we were in the right area.  Of course we cant see fer nuthin  but I tell you, the lack of undergrowth around here is smashing good!  You can be stupid AND safe!  and it quickly becomes obvious the coordinates are nowhere near to the right place. p Oh goody... again! p No idea how long we banged around in here.  In the dark every minute is at least 10.  If we faced up hill, we couldnt see a thing b/c of the bright lights at the skate park.  If we faced downhill, we couldnt see a thing because, well... it was just dark. p Somehow we ended up working our way closer to the trail and on one more downhill pass, I saw the glow of the white lid in the dark... peeking out from underneath half of a log. p Thank God. p I poked it with my Pokey Stick to make sure it was what we were seeking and called JM and RC over for a look see. p Box open. p Overfull log book and all the extra papers out. p Hand cache to the kid so she can fish through it. p Wait...  theres no pen in the baggie.  Hand the box back! p Box back. No friggin pen. THREE unsharpened pencils tho, mind you.  But, theres NO PEN! p I take one out and start to gnaw on the end trying to break down the wood enough to scribble something. p Do you have a knife?, I asked JM.  He scoffed.  I figure if I keep asking, eventually... one day... he will have one. p What are you going to do, sign it with blood?  Something like that, yeah. p He told me hed head back to the rig to get the pen wed been toting around with us all evening. p RC wasnt too thrilled we were now alone in the dark.  She started singing.  I kept gnawing. p Just as I was finally getting to a piece of led that wasnt broken, a flashlight broke through the darkness and JM returned with a pen. p Phew! p We did our civic duty and signed the log book... rehid the cache so it wasnt quite as obvious, and took new coordinates. p In a nutshell, the cache is about 60 off... and closer to the trail than the coordinates took us. p Thanks!
  -  Who needs a stinkin flashlight when caching in dark? CurmudgeonlyGal, RealityCheck  5yo  and I thrashed about in the dark looking for this elusive easy find. After 3 or 4 weeks, CGal found the cache  yes, it was completely uncovered . Then, theres no working pen in said cache. So.... off I go back to the car for a flashlight  with nearly dead batteries  and purple felt tip pen  no, there was no grown up ballpoint pen in the car . Then back to the cache where Cgal and kiddo are waiting, patiently, in the dark. wow. TNLN. 
  -  TFTC SL took dog and car left clip watch and fashion clip watch great spot nice hike
  -  TNLNSL
  -  Nice semi warm afternoon.  Had a nice hike with the kids.  Almost gave up then we saw it quite a bit away from where GPSr was pointing us.  Took McDonalds toy and left some shells and a corvette.
  -  I took my daughter with me for the first time and she was thrilled when we discovered the cache.  We took Curious George and left an Extreme skateboard keychain.  TFTH.
  -  Found our first Cache.  Tried to find it earlier in the week with my Yellow Etrex and couldnt quite get it.  So used the Etrexs Bearing along with my compass to help find it. Nice hide.  Needs a new log book...its full.
  -  Our first find!  Took a blue car and left a Shark Tales game.
  -  16th of 23 for the day. TNLNSL. Thanks for the hunt.

  -  My wife and I go to this park once or twice a week to play tennis and never knew this trail was there.  I love how Geocaching gets you out to places you have never noticed.  Found the cach without much trouble.  Left camo tape, took Napoleon Dynamite trading card  what a great movie  p  This entry was edited by jwsmith6 on Monday, January 10, 2005 at 6 50 23 AM. 
  -  This was a good find, but the biggest find was the skate park and watching the bmx riders. Z is finally ready to learn to ride.  Thanks for getting us out to this park!  We took some toy coins and left a watch.  This was our fifth for the day and the first for A.
  -  Came across a man and his sons who were trying to find the same cache. So turned around and let them seek. Not sure that they found it. We found the box after about 10 15 minutes.  Our first find! Took the britsh penny left yesterday and left a coin from the United Arab Emirates.  br This cache needs another log book. We left a piece of notebook paper...
  -  Nice warm winter day. My son and I found it relatively easily.  Took an oriental coin, left an old British penny.
  -  Thank you! We took a yoyo and left a match box car.
  -  This was our first cache!  Just logged our visit, as we didnt have anything to trade, but we had fun    br 
  -  Found the cache.  First one ever for my wife, daughter, and myself.  Took a small green frog, left a Y100 coin. p Took about 10 minutes, but from the right angle it was easy to spot. p Jerome
  -  Our first cache as well. Got a GPS for Christmas and had to try it out. It was an overcast day with a cold wind but we had fun. Left a tiny mickey mouse toy, took a net/ball game. Thanks!  br P.S. your log book is full.
  -  Our first cache!  Thanks to our friends the HashCachers  see previous comment  for introducing us to the sport.  Well hopefully have many more successes   and a few failures     to report from Holland and around.
  -  We tried to show our friends visiting from Holland how great it is to have a geocache right in our backyard, but we failed to find it on our first try. Had to cheat and print out the photo and although the area no longer looks the same because of the storms, we were finally able to find it. Good thing we didnt try a 4 or 5 on the difficulty scale or we would have really been in trouble.
  -  5 00PM Staying at Rolling View Campground in the Falls Lake Recreation Area for the weekend, geocaching was the name of the game.

  -  This was the first of four caches we attempted today and was a good one to use to introduce some friends to the sport. Got to the location easily, but took a few minutes to locate the cache. br Took  A tennis ball   Left  Bernard from The Rescuers br Great cache. Thanks.
  -  We finally found it.  I met my wife and son at the park after work and we located the cache.  My wife was actually the one who found it.  Took a Nemo toy, left a yo yo.  The log book in the cache is full.
  -  I tried again today before church with no luck.  My son woke up this morning asking to go caching.  Those were the first words out of his mouth.  Im just not sure how close my GPS is getting me and how far around the point I should be searching.  I am fairly certain the cache is still there, just need to figure out how/where to search.
  -  Just got a GPS today and tried to find this cache as our first.  My wife, son and I looked twice, once before reading the hint and once afterwards.  We never did find it.  Not sure if its because it was getting dark or if its because were new to doing this.  Hopefully well go back with lots of daylight and try again.
  -  Fun little cache.  TFTH  Took nothing, left a geobutton.  Thanks!!
  -  Found with the son after a few minutes of searching.  SL & swapped a BK ?  Nemo toy for the rubber fly.  Caught it from the wife for letting him get the bug, but we had fun.  Thanks!
  -  Found it with the family, but late posting the log. Just as described.  Nice cache for kids.  Thanks for the hunt.

  -  First of three on a slow day cachingwise.  A nice easy find even if the gps is acting up  again    amazing how you can jump 100 feet while standing still! p Left the Cubone TB whos on his way to Florida.
  -  While searching for Sign O the Times I noticed the Skate Park near here and stopped to take a picture of the Lucious Lenny TB next to the Skate Park.  As I was going back to my car, the thought that there might be a cache in the park popped into my head so I pulled out my Palm and did a nearest caches search and this one popped up.  So, I loaded it into the GPSr and away I went.  Found it almost immedately.  Took a pez dispenser and left a pinwheel.  Thanks for a good cache.
  -  We went to our own cache to find Quackers the Duck travel bug, initiated from California 19 months ago by Caseys cousin, Brian.  Congratulations, Quackers!!! p Note  Cache location is the same, but the view is different than the true spoiler pictured above.  Many trees have been cut down since that picture was taken. br

  -  Our second find for this one. It kept popping up on our br to do list so off we went. Recognized the spot but had  br to check the log to see when we were there.  br 15 November 03! Right before RedWolf Team; we met br the comming out that day. Anyway, well log it today. br Swapped out some small creatures. Thanks. p Allegahney2
  -  Took my mt. bike and set a route of 10 caches. This was the fourth. Nice spot. Thanks for the cache, cause I never knew this small park existed until now.  TNLN + SL. Covered it much better than I found it. Thank You.
  -  Found with jklGoDuke.  Now I have an account of my own!  This was the first one that I actually spotted before my Mom did.
  -  Biked all the way from crabtree lake with a 30 lb passenger.  He was happy to play in the playground for a while, then we looked for the cache.  This is the first cache that my 2 year old son has spotted before I did!  He took an airplane, I took a bat.  We left a dolphin and a mini fan. p  This entry was edited by jklGoDuke on Sunday, May 09, 2004 at 8 12 34 PM. 
  -  My wife and I wanted to take a walk today, so we decided to hunt down Caseys geocache.  When we finally found the cache  it took us a while to find its hiding spot , we entered our find in the logbook, took nothing and left a golfing Snoopy and Woodstock figure.  Thanks Casey.
  -  Found the cache quickly before the rains came.  Took the TB Rainbow Mist Doubloon, we left a candle and 3 pairs of shoe laces.  I think I can help the Doubloon find a higher overlook a little west of here, look for the Doubloon next week. 
  -  This one needs to be better hidden, but fun anyway. tn/ln.
  -  Came with my brother.  The cache was not buried at all.  We saw it from the trail.  TNLNSL.  Thanks for the find!  CACHE ON!
  -  I left a geocoin
  -  Yes!  My first geocache find!  When I was there yesterday, my GPS receiver had me on the wrong side of the trail.  Much better success today.  Very nice spot for a hide.  All the rainy weather recently didnt seem to have affected the contents of the cache.  I enjoied looking through the goodies and signing the log.  Great cache, Casey! p Took nothing, left nothing.
  -  My first ever geocache attempt.  Wish I couldve found the treasure, though!  Ill try again another day.
  -  Failsafe4277 and Shortcake75s first cache of the day. Easter day. Skies were overcast and temp. flucuated during the day. Cache was well hidden and secure. Took a bunny book, considering the day and left a Garbage CD. Hope someone gets to enjoy the tunes. SL.

  -  Found this one while we were in town from Aiken, SC for the soccer games   took a break before the game between LA and Kansas City.  We didnt have a very good map of the city, but a little dead reckoning with the GPS and we got there with no problem.  Will found it.  Very nice little park, actually a very nice city to vist and explore with the GPS.
  -  Nice find on a rainy lunch hour.  Took Vulcan to help him along.
  -  Found it.  Saw Vulcan travel bug in there.  Took nothing, left nothing.  Thanks for the hunt. p Total Package and Son
  -  Our first find with the new GPS! The blanket of snow made it a little more challenging, but we found it.

Thanks for the cache! p The Three Investigators br  And Jessie, the GoofaSaurus

We put in a green Mardi Gras necklace and an orange heart bracelet; we took a Sock Mockey pin and a blue sparkle bracelet. Thanks!

  -  After 1 divorce and 2 years of geocaching retirement, I’m back!  Thanks karennc for placing this great cache and helping me out of my depressed state.  My kids loved it!  We took a Canadian quarter  close to my heart having lived 45 minutes from Windsor, Ontario , a plastic lizard, and the “Happy Couple” that my daughter just had to have.  We left a McToy, some bouncy balls, and a special item for your 4 year old son that he may be able to use in about 10 years; a small can of shaving cream.  Somebody please pick this up before the oppressive summer heat causes it to burst inside the cache container.  Great fun, thanks a million and happy trails.
  -  Indeed this was an easy one to end our Geocaching day  img src http //www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle . This was three of three today, and my son, Addison  6 , really enjoyed the treasures in your trove. I liked the bugs, but ultimately he chose a Kirby toy for his brother, Kirby  2  the next big thing , and left a nice Mardi Gras collectors doubloon. p A fun trip to end our adventuring today. p Cheers, p The Callan Crew

  -  I was working in the area on business and grabbed some caches before I left today.  I was looking for a cache to leave a TBug in besides the TBug hotel.  I wanted it to stay in the area.  This one was a good one.  It was a pretty easy find but fun all the same.  I had hoped the TBug was still in the cache but it was gone a few days earlier.  I left the Rusty Wallace TBug and took one of the frog stickers for my PDA case.  Now I have a signal frog on my case!  Thanks for the cache, my 518th! br Good Hiking… mtn man from Georgia br

  -  Man!  We walked into so many huge spiderwebs!  EWWW  Oh well, you would think you would see that formation and be like, duh   look there but no, the foliage had me fooled for a while.

Conan was a little impatient as well  difficult to find the cache under pressure! Took trash bag, left AA batteries. My GPS died just as I arrived to do another cache today, so I thought maybe it might help someone else who was running low. Nice cache in my own neighborhood. Thanks! p  br

There was one point when my GPS said 6 feet, and I was actually at least 50 feet from the location of the cache. p I also think the ice storm probably downed a lot of trees in the area. p Other than that, I had a great time.

  -  Second cache for the day.  This one took us a little while.  The GPS was being flakey with all the trees around.  Once I got to the right area, it was easy to spot.  We left a pirates eye patch and a pink koosh dude.  To a little alien, a pen and a tattoo.

  -  This one needs to be archived until the owners can make it back out.  br Visiting this area and decided to check on the cache. Cache was laying out in the open. Contents are gone. Put container back in its place and camoed really good.  I love this spot and would hate to see a cache fall by the wayside here in b town.

  -  very nice find.  my first one
  -  My first cache find.  I found this one with peacecamp, but I spotted it first.  It was pretty exciting!  TNLNSL
  -  Took cuttermike with me. He spotted it first. It was cool to watch someone find their first cache. TNLNSL

  -  Found this one after work with Frog72. We walked across dam and straight to the cache. Cache not too heavily hidden. Hope it last till grass grows in area. Thanks for bringing me to this beautiful area. TNLNSL
  -  I tried this one before but didnt check long since a guy was hanging around the area and asking me questions.  Today I tried it again with Helixblue and our dog, and we found it pretty quickly.  We left a Stress Ball.
  -  found 12 12 04 8 30am.Now...this was a real adventure!Started by walking across the field,but the water was rushing too fast to go that way, and the gate was locked going up.So..I went back out to the road and cheated around the stream.Finally found my way to the cache.Going out,I found an open gate,walked across the top to another gate,then down a very steep hill to the truck.But,all in all,it was worth it.Took a carabiner,left 2 army guys and one of my cards.thanx.Doc
  -  I parked in the little lot and walked across the field. I saw no large land mines.  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle  I got to the spillway area and a lot of water going through it. I really got wet feet. Got to the cache area and spent about five min. looking for it. I took the travel bug and the runing around the block gag prize. I left a Cache Commando Wooden Nickel and some play doo. I walked back across the dam. Thanks for a enjoyable cache. CC
  -  Interesting area. T cat, L army guy.  Thanks for the cache!
  -  I tried to find this geocache yesterday during my lunch hour, but after a little while of looking around, a guy came by and started questioning me about what I was doing and the travelbugs I was carrying.  He seemed to be following me around and was making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to just go back another time when I have someone else with me.  
  -  We went out one evening last week to try to find this cache, but there were so many people  and dogs.. big wet dogs!  out there.  It got dark pretty quickly, so we gave up to go back this evening. We found it within a minute through luck!  Good hide!  Left a fitness block. TN.
  -  It wasnt THAT bad of a hike up there.  I think its just intimidating walking through the DOG park WITHOUT a dog.  That was harder than the hill. Everyone looks at you wondering what you are up to.  Found it.  Traded travel bugs and took a yoyo, left a key chain & stickers.
  -  I found this cash with my crew of four cache hunters and we had a ball.  I have lived in and around Bloomington most of my life. I have driven by Griffy Lake before but in good busybody style I have never stopped to smell the roses. I think that is one of the things I like most about this sport. I love the woods but sometimes you need a good reason to get out there and geocaching gives you that reason. Sorry didnt mean to wax philosopical. This was a great location for a cache. We arrived with no trouble and my four hunters went to work.  We checked every hollow tree in the area because all our caches to this point were in hollow places. It did take us a good 20 minutes to locate. This is a great hiding place. I took a few pictures that I will post. We picked up swallowtail TB and left The Sporting Life  Bowling across America TB. p  This entry was edited by Trurichez on Thursday, September 02, 2004 at 8 15 46 AM.

  -  I will check and see if someone can replace the cache. I am disabling it until I know for sure that is will not be replaced.  p Mointain Climber
  -  went back with people who had found it previously   and they agreed it was no longer there... p may need to be archived...
  -  boo for failure. parked at the truck graveyard then headed in on the trailhead there, took a right and followed what seemed to be a dry creek before doing the uphill bushwhack   but no luck. any hints would be appreciated. p if anyones planning on doing this one id love to tag along and try again...
  -  THANKS FOR THE HUNT br L SIG CARD
  -  Very nice hike in griffey.  Had to hunt around to find this one.  
  -  Not sure if its the one, accidentally found a cache near these cords, but its in a plastic container and not a coffee can as described, thought it might be another one, what the odds!  Heres the pis of the cache, its all wet therefore we didnt take anything or sign the log book.  Still, its a good hike, thanks!
  -  Went the on the wrong trail and climbed a lot of unnecessary ridges, but this led us to a dried river bed where we found a lot of geode rocks. This was my second cache and my buddies first, we booth had a great time. Hike was great, it does feel very remote once you are out there. Contents are still all wet. Still including the two old logbooks. The new temporary log book was fine and dry. Took the Images of Hawaii CD and left a small NASCAR tin. 
  -  We finally found it!  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle   We took the path from the east from the truck graveyard. It was shorter but steeper!  There were two old log books frozen, ruined, so we left a little temporary one until a new one can be put in. Everything was wet and icy.  Took nothing.
  -  Nice hike .... cache was really waterlogged so we couldnt sign the log book.
  -  THIS IS A GRATE WALK IN I LOVE IT THANKS TNLC
  -  Whew! p After an inadvertent bushwhack, I finally found it!   Leaves   poor signal.  p I removed a nasty ziplock bag and aired out the other one so that all of the doodads could go inside of it.  p The original logbook is still soaked and mouldy and sealed in a separate ziplock bag. p Took  a bouncy ball br Left  two vintage postcards of Bloomington  in their own ziplock baggie 
  -  After finding it I remembered....I forgot to mark the location of the car. Two hours later I am at the IU Golf Course! The funny thing is my husband and I left a golf ball, tee, and ball marker in the box!  So, bring your clubs and hit the back end of the course! Saw two deer, two snake, and a chipmunk ran under my husbands arm! Thanks for the trip! It was our first! Nice location! I need to lose weight!
  -  Had a nice trip through the woods looking for this one.  Spent about 45 minutes stomping around all sides of the sinkhole and ridge with no luck.. Hope it wasnt down at the bottom of the sinkhole, because it was filled about waist deep with water.  Did get startled by what I can only assume was a coyote.  He was much bigger than any dog Ive seen.  Very nice tan and white coat.  Tried to get a picture but he disappeared too quickly.  Also scared some college kids who figured they should follow natures lead and try to mate in the woods next to the creek.  They ran off quicker than the coyote!!!  Will try again next week or the week after that.  Was the best trip out at Griffey despite not finding the cache!
  -  Found this cache with Jbyer323 and Erin.  We hiked up hills, followed the needle straight as the crow flies for some of it.   p Good cache, we transported the Zenith bug to a different cache   img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile.gif border 0 align middle 
  -  Had a good time traipsing through the woods with firecrafter695 and jbyer323 to find this one. What a location! Its beautiful back there, albeit navigating the ridges when we discovered wed have to do some pretty exenstive pole vaulting to get to the other side got tiring. ;  p T   TB, L   plastic snake, SL. 
  -  Found this cache, along with firecrafter695 and luxtiger. p Beautiful park, will definitely come back and visit again. p Logbook is still soaked, so used the one that wireman 131 left. p Took the Zenith way travel bug, left a scary rubber snake. p  This entry was edited by JByer323 on Friday, March 19, 2004 at 6 09 47 PM. 
  -  Not being from this area I totally relied on the GPS on this one.  Looked like an approach from the east would be the best.    Drove down what seemed like a long driveway, got to the end, and found what looked like a graveyard of old trucks..  There was the sign for the park hidden in the corner.  Just then, the attack guard dog made his presence known, and tried biting my tires...  Not a good start..  I decided to try approaching from the west.  Drove all the way around, then found the Actual park.  A little longer walk, but without dogs.. a good thing.  Trails were muddy today, but at least the river seemed low as to make an easy crossing.   When I got to the cache location I spotted it right away.. it was about 40 feet away from any obvious hiding spot, laying right in the open.  It seemed to be intact however.  I rehid it in the most logical spot in that area  I hope its the right spot!    p The log book was SOAKED!  so I left a new, dry logbook, and the Zenith way Travel Bug I got in New Mexico.  Took a star, and a matchbox car.  The owner of this cache should check on it soon, and retrieve the soggy log book.   Also, make sure I rehid it in the right spot   Thanks for the cache, it was a great day!  Wireman 131 br 
  -  Found this one taking the long way also. Was a great day for it. Thanks br TNLN
  -  My wife and I found it on our second try. The first try was yesterday    this was not especially easy to find. We were motivated to find it today because it was placed two years ago this day. This is our first cache! We took nothing, left a rubber ball. Thanks!
  -  We followed the needle straight through the woods up steep hills and down ravines....beautifull Fall weather...good aerobic workout.  Cache in tupperware is damp and molding so we took nothing and left nothing.  We have found in MN that the 2 qt. thermos containers work really well to keep out all kinds of weather.  With the risk of sounding like alarmists, we found scat near the cache that is identical to Northwoods black bear droppings.  Any comments? p Bullthistle and Tansy
  -  I was not sure where any trail started.  Drove around looking for a place to park and came up empty.  How about adding parking coordinates for us out of towners? p JPlus14 br Floyds Knobs, IN p  last edit  9 21 2003 7 47 59 PM PST 
  -  Nice hike.  I think I must have gone the long way around, but the trail was real nice and quiet.  Came up on a couple of deer.  The container had some water in it.  I dumped it out and closed it securely.  Took and left nothing, but signed the log. br Jnick
  -  Should have read the past history, then we would have taken the side path and not the main path.  Didnt want to get more chiggers than necessary, so well go back again another day and go the correct way.  First time weve followed the creek path that far. This is our favorite place to get a quick hike in so close to home. Kids got tired and hungry, so we said wed go back another day and find it.
  -  Went to the coordinates and found a Large Tupper Ware Container not a Folgers Can, some contents were wet so I dried them best as I could. log was writeable so signed it and left the Beast and took Bugs Bunny Thanks for the hunt
  -  Nice hike.  Musta took the wrong trail though because I ended up traipsing through the woods for a bit.  Took some chapstick and left a hand warmer.  
  -  This was our first Geocache.  Took the trail along the creek, then turned up the hill and walked straight to it.  Great hike, lots of fun!  I think Im going to like this sport! p  last edit  4 15 2003 8 41 55 AM PST 
  -  This was my third attempt to find this cache.  The first time I did not find the park.  The second time I did not find the correct trail, and it was too late to backtrack.  This time I picked the right trail.  I got to within .25 miles and started to bushwhack.  What a hike.  Really made my heart pound, scaling that steep terrain.  I found the cache with no problems.  It was dry and in good condition.  I followed the top of the ridge back and it made for easier going.  Thanks for hiding this cache. p DutchBoy
  -  Zoiks!  I  mustve  taken the wrong trail.  Ended up having to Bushwhack for at least 1 4 mi UP a ridge to get there. p When I got to the coords, I was convinced I had written them down wrong since I couldnt find  any  evidence of a trail within 100meters of the place.  p I was planning on calling it a screw up on my part cause I was looking at my notes that said relatively easy and pleasant hike... and figured Jeepers! I cant imagine a 1 4 mi bushwack up 30%grade as relatively easy BUT I figured since I was in the hood, may as well give it a few minutes before giving up.  Glad I did  since I found it  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle   .  p Tried to locate a trail back but gave up and followed a circuitous deer path along the ridge back to the creek deer droppings make for great trail markers!  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_tongue.gif border 0 align middle   p Took  spidey br Left  Mardi Gras Beads p A  delightful  hike!.  Im definitely coming back here to see what other trails this great area has to offer. TONS of geodes in the creek, if youre into that sort of thing. p Fun Cache, thanks! br  Capn Chaos
  -  This was my 100th find! Horray! We had been in this area a few times before but didnt have enough daylight to do this one. We like keeping the longer more scenic caches for day time to do them justice and Im sure glad we did. This area was beautiful. We took the rigdetop route on the way in and had to back track a little. We were so busy enjoying the sites we missed our turn to start bushwacking. Down the hill, across the creek and back up the other side. As we approached the cache I was thinking this was a sink hole from a cave. After walking around a little more and investigating, we determined that it was probably an old damn for a small pond. We found the cache without any problems. TN but I dont remember what I left. On the way out we took the creek route. Shortly after leaving the cache Remi jumped up some deer. Just so happened they ran in the direction we were headed.  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle  We later spotted them again on the opposite hill side. We counted six but there may have been one more. We watched them for a while and they watched us making sure they kept thier distance. Onward to the creek we went and a turkey ran across the trail right in front of us. They are like a Boeing 747 taking off in flight but they run into stuff like they are crash landing. Going up or going down....not sure if they even know. Continued on to the lake to see hundreds of geese. Honk Honk is there some kind of traffic jam or what? All in all this was a great cache. We hiked 2.6 miles, seen deer, a turkey, geese and some ice fisherman. I cant think of a better way to celabrate my 100th find. Thanks for making it so memorable
  -  We also started out on the wrong trail and probably did a lot of hiking that wasnt necessary, but I wouldnt consider it wasted time at this cache.  It is a really pretty area.  We went up the hill right by the parking area and walked the top all the out and around, I glanced at the GPS and realized we were going farther away from it so we backtracked a little then went bushwacking.  Down through the creek bottoms, across the creek, and up the other side, we found it with no problem.  The cache was dry inside, but as previously mentioned there isnt much in it, TN and left 3 glow in the dark stars, 2 nail files, a tube of chapstick and a Hawaii screen saver CD.  Checked out the neat views and took a few pics then started back toward the truck.  Remi got on a scent trail and jumped a deer, when we walked through where she had jumped her there were a bunch of beds, and since they were going the direction we needed to go we pretty much followed their trail.  Got to see them again across the next valley, there were at least 6.  We watched them for a while and I tried to get a pic but they were too far away.  Finally got to the trail that follows the creek and had a turkey run across in front of us, then take off in flight, crashing through the trees. They fly like I Geocache.  Stopped to get a pic of the rock formation with icicles hanging down.  Knew we were close to the truck now because we could hear the geese honking!  2.6 miles of hiking, 6 deer, and a turkey later our adventure was over!  Thanks for a great hike!
  -  15 20 br Wow! This was a pretty tough one. We parked at the lake and walked up along the creek, then went cross country. GPS signal was poor, had us going all over! This must be really tough in the summer. Finally found it! Cache in good shape. Contents sparse, so took nothing, left a Hot Wheels. Thanks for the workout! p Boundertom + Mrs
  -  We were in the area, helping one of the geocaching team move from Bloomington back to Ohio. Very hilly around this cache! Took something and left a dollar ring. A great hike and a great cache. p   Wheres North  
  -  Sorry about the bad state of the cache!  I went and visited the cache today and indeed found it completely rusted through and soggy.  I replaced it with a Sterilite container.   I had to take all of the contents back with me to clean and or replace.  I left in there a log book, a Virginia quarter, 5 silver  pre 1964  dimes, and a Bugs Bunny figurine.  Ill come by in the next week and add more fun things  and check to see if the Sterilite container is working .  Thanks, and sorry again about the lack of maintenance on the cache.  Cheers,  geoff br 
  -  Actually, this one was relatively easy to find. Quite tricky to walk there, though, need a bit of mountaineering spirit I guess, but the cache was right where the GPS suggested it would be. br I drove around the area quite a bit in my car, trying to get as near to the spot as possible. Managed to get within 0.25 miles of the cache. Parked my car, hiked up a steep hill, down a ravine, crossed  a dried out river bed, up another steep hill, and there it was. Found a scary skeleton along the way   hope it wasnt you, Dutchboy?? br All in all, the army put me through worse. And at least there was no drill sergant shouting at me. br Anyway, the cache is in serious need of maintenance. Next one to plan a trip there, please bring a medium sized container with you, the cache needs a new one.
  -   A HREF http   pages.rtccom.net kholland geocaching.htm target _blank Users web page  A  br Well this was my second try for this cache, and still unsuccessful.  The first time, I could not find the park.  This time, I found the park, but I chose the wrong trail to begin on.  It was not until 1 mile later that I realized that I was getting farther away from the cache.  I decided to call it a day, because it was getting dark, and I had to drive on into Nashville.  I will come back and, hopefully, pick the right trail next time.  Thanks p DutchBoy
  -  Need to get on the correct trail at the beginning.  You can waste a lot of time on trails that dont get you close enough.
  -   A HREF http   mywebpages.comcast.net indydiver  target _blank Users web page  A  br I found the cache at 2.30PM. I took a little different approach to find this one. I parked 0.16 miles from the cache. In doing so I made this cache a lot more difficult and even a little on the dangerous side. One thing for sure, I had a lot of fun getting to the cache and enjoyed the challenge as well. I was going to place a travel Bug in the cache but upon finding it I decided to move on to another cache to place it. This cache is in serious need of some maintenance. The new logbook is in fine shape but the cache leaks and has holes rusted through it. If I had brought a container with me I would have switched it out.  br Even the buttons placed in the cache were starting to rust.  br I took nothing and left a State Quarter. br Nonetheless I had a really fine time.  br Thanks for the challenge. p Cache On! br Indy Diver br 
  -  Gigger and I found this cache EXACTLY the same way as Team J&K.  p We parked at the lake near where the trails start, .8 miles from the cache. br It wasnt until after we left the cache that I figured out what had happened. p  br The trail is well marked. Its so well marked that when the trail 1st meets the creek bed that you FAIL to notice the path splits here and there is another trail on the other side of the creek. Before this point the trail has well placed markers made of good wood with colored arrows,at the creek it doesnt. So you end up walking straight ahead on the original path.  br On the path you are supposed to take there are numerous bike tire ruts and occasional litter. I dont think that the trail you really end up taking is marked by those responsible for the area, but others wanting to have a good riding trail.  p What happened to us  br Gigger and I walked on the original path until it seemed we would get no closer to the cache. Our GPSs said we were .23 miles from the cache up the side of a very steep and rather tall hill.  I couldnt find a trail anywhere near there so we had to make a decision to bushwack or not. We went back a little way to the creek bed where the trail DOES cross it. I walked a 100 feet or so down the creek until I estimated that we were closest to the hill we needed to go up and that it was at its lowest grade. We went inland. The grade was about 40 degrees so that was a pretty good hike to get up to the top where of course we found we had to cross a large ravine. br At this point we were privaleged to see the falling of a very large limb from one of the large trees, no wind or anything, it just went. We were about 100 feet away, what a crash!  I wonder if it would have made any sound if no one was there to hear it?  HA HA!  p We followed our GPSs through the brush until we came to the cache. I spotted the cache as its in plain site. I had Ginger go down and sign the log as I then went around the top of the site looking for a trail that I knew had to be around there somewhere. p I did find a small trail that we followed and lost and found several times. Which eventually led to the forementioned riding trail.  br It was a LOT easier going down than coming up! p Interesting start of our cache day and it took a lot longer than I thought it would.  br Thanks for fun cache! p  br 
  -  First cache of the day.  Nice little walk.  The way we came in it wa a little hard to find the trails back out.  Ummm...I missed the right trail going in but was still a nice walk all the same. p Took nothing but left behind some geocaching pins. br  The contents are soaked except for the log book which looks like it might be a newer one as the old one still in there is ruined.  It is laying on its lid now to keep the water out and that should help. br                            Ginger p  last edit  7 11 2002 10 29 17 AM PST 
  -  I think I came in a different way than most.  I parked near a lot of old pickup trucks and bushwacked to the cache.  It was a short but steep walk.  I found the cache with no problem.  It looks like an animal has chewed the top of the container a little so some water was getting into the cache.  Thanks for placing this cache in such a beautiful area. p BruceS br St. Peters, MO
  -  Great area but was it ever HARD.  We started at the lake   seemed easy enough for awhile.  Then needed to leave the main trail.  Not bad.  Then had to cross a creek and climb a hill.  J found the cache with little problem.  Then our Etrex decided that it didnt want to play  dense trees?  so there we were with no GPS, not sure what direction to go, and no real idea how to go back the way we came.  GPS Gods gave us a break and we got the signal back after several minutes so that we could head back to our waypoint where we left the trail.  We arent sure at all that we started where we were supposed to but we think this was plenty hard for 2 1 2 stars.  Thanks for the hike and the interesting area   we cant believe how lost we were within city limits! p  last edit  5 27 2002 3 23 42 PM PST

I dont know if I started in the right spot or not. Started in on some steps. I followed it back in and after 30 min. of hiking was taking me the wrong way. Started to bushwack and came to a small stream and what looks like an old bridge pier. GPS showed up and up we went. That is an evil hill.  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_evil.gif border 0 align middle  Had to stop and rest a couple of times. When I got to the top looked like an old Rail Road Grade bed. Followed it right to the cache. I was standing on the old rail road bed and could see the part of a red can down in the vally. Nice to have it partly covered, and partly open. Hate to put this much effort into finding a cache and not be able to find it. On the way in I jumped two deer and eight wild turkies. Took a J. S. Bach CD and left a stuffed animal. I made a way point and it showed .86 miles to auto. I traveler farther than that. Trip back was easer. Except for the evil hill, I could have crashed and burned real easy here. This cache is under rated needs more stars! I am glad I DID IT.

  -  This was my first cache  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle !  I thoroughly enjoyed the hunt.  Although this was the third attempt to find this cache.   p On Sunday, January 27th, our first attempt my wife and I went out. Going up a steep hill, I decided it was best to let our dogs off lead so we could use our hands if we needed to.  Samson our Lab Retriever mix decided it would be a great time to get additional exercise.   This concerned his mistress a great deal.  A decision was made that we should return back to the car, in the hopes Samson would meet us there.  Well we walked about 5 minutes and Samson joined us again.  But the wife wanted to call it quits for the day.  p Another attempt on the cache was made on Sunday, February 3.  This time we kept both dogs on leads the entire time.  But I believe that I might be navigationally impaired.  I studied and studied the topographical maps prior to this expedition, and we climbed the hill I thought where the cache was.  Much to my chagrin, the GPS showed that we were .36 miles away from the cache.  My more sane half, also known as my wife was starting to feel her ankle muscles, and was concerned about falling in the terrain.  Discretion being the better part of valor, we returned unsuccessful with dreams of discovery at a later date.  To note though, Samson was quite unhappy about the fate of being on a leash the entire time.   p Today I made the assault on the discovery of this cache without my partner of 26 years being with me.  It was just Samson and I.  Which turned out to be a good thing, otherwise my wife would probably never attempt a Geocache again.  It has been confirmed at least in my weary mind that I have a serious navigational impairment.  Along with a serious shortage of patient planning skills.  I wont go into the details of the route Samson and I took to finally arrive at the route.  But we did manage to climb up some rather steep grades.  Samson was on lead the entire time, and after today, I dont think he ever wants to go for a walk in the woods again.  The way out was quite interesting as well.  When I was a kid I remember going head first down a hill on a sled.  Today I went down a hill head first without a sled img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_blush.gif border 0 align middle .  Nothing injured but my pride.   p I had a great time.  I might become a Geocache addict.   p Anyhow, I took the plastic Viox bag, and I left a Leader Dog for Blind sewing kit.   p Great Job on Cache placement.  I enjoyed this search immensely.  By the way, my GPS read dead on in regards to the coordinates. br   p

  -  We found the right place to park and made this one easy except for one steep muddy hillside.  The container was out in the open and little teeth marks were in the top, plus everything was scattered.  I put everything back together and left you a new pen.  RATED Hiking Boots
  -  Amy and I found the cache after a considerable amount of hiking as we really didnt know where the best place to start would be.  We happened to take a difficult starting point which made our hike much more grueling.  We left a parmaceutical bag and took the Luke Skywalker figurine. br                           Andy Matthews br                           amos&andy p 
  -  I dont think there is an easy way to get to this one. Team Dragon Along came on this after a nice climb. This was a unique place to hide a cache. I took nothing and left nothing. Thanks for the hunt.

After sitting and resting in the nice peaceful hole we took the Uruguay Box and left a USA air freshener. Going back was a little easier catching the trail going down the hill following the creek. It was cold but the hike warm us up so much I took my gloves off and lost one. Thanks for the fun.  Oh yeah dont forget to put a log book in.  2Jos

  -  Found it right away, liked the hide.  Signed log.  Thanks for the cache.
  -  This one was a little more difficult than I had originally planned on.  I, of course, completely ignored the obvious item  the cache  and wandered around for a couple of minutes before suggesting my son look someplace special.  Im glad nobody was looking because he screamed in victory as the cache was discovered.... p Thanks! p Angry Angel  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_evil.gif border 0 align middle

  -  Stopped by this cache after work today.  It was a nice walk along the road.  Only saw one other person   a dogwalker.  Found the cache easily.  Thanks for the cache.
  -  Found this one at 9 00A after searching for crossed sticks for a little while.  It sure seemed to be too warm for February!  I am down to Atlanta from Middlebury, Vermont on business and enjoying the great caches in this park.  I arrived at dawn and this cache is number three of the day.  Took a flashlight and left a red radio.
  -  My girls and I had a great time exploring the park and finding this cache today   three trips to the playground, checking out the old mill, watching some horseback riders, and also finding a letterbox, only to discover that we had left our ink back in the car!  Oh well.  We will be definitely be back to follow through with that and to work on the many other caches around here.  Thanks for the fun time.
  -  Thanks for the cache Solar.  
  -  Found this cache pretty quickly. Very nice park too. I took the plastic match box and left a can cooler and SL. Thanks br Shilo    Hiram, GA
  -  My stepfather and I  Boo  hunted for several of the Cochrane Mill caches today.  This was the first actual find of the day.  Found the X first, and soon after, the cache.  Took a sunglass case and left several toys.
  -  Pleasant walk.  Good hiding place and the X was easy enough to find.  Enjoyable hunt.  Took nothing, left nothing.
  -  Nice walk on a nice day. Would have been a nice bike ride too. The distance was correct, the heading wasnt. Took a magnet, left a Gateway key chain. Thanks Solar. 
  -  Nice hide, this cache convinced us to invest in a compass. br T Play doh br L Hotwheels Petty car br SL
  -  Going paperless does you no good if you leave your PDA in the hotel room   . After finding the X I couldnt remember what to do next so I called Donna on my cell and as she was looking it up I managed to stumble upon the cache. I took nothing and left a mini carabiner and CITO kit. Took the TB Hootie and will move him south towards warmer climate for the winter. TFTC!
  -  Very enjoyable cache. I was able to find this one after spending a lot of time on another on the way that I dont believe is there anymore. I love a no frills ammo box in a park that you have to do some walking or biking to get to.  p Also, I sometimes grow weary telling onlookers just exactly what I am doing and usually give the rare insect story unless I feel they are truly interested. Today I met some folks who would have to do a lot of explaining because they were even stranger than geocachers,They were dressed in costume and acting out a fantsy storyline. see   a href http   games.groups.yahoo.com group elfstonelarp  target _blank visit link  a   
  -  We were so happy to find this cache!  The bugs, high water, and heavy tree coverage  no GPS reception  made us abandon the other caches in the area.  But this one we found with no problem.  Well, once we figured out which was was south. p Took nothing, dropped off Hootie TB.
  -  This was a great day to take alittle hike. We didnt realize that Cochran Mill was as large as it is. Took the Jason TB, a clamp and a wooden nickle. Left beads, hand warmer  will be handy in another month or so and a crayon sharpener. Thanks
  -  Nice walk.  Pretty area.  Left a TB
  -  X did mark the spot on this one.  Excellent hide
  -  Jessicas first find. 3rd one for the day. Left JD pin, took lock. Signed log. Thanks for the cache.
  -  My son and I had a good time m\walking in the park.  Found the cache with no problems and made a few new Geocaching friends along the way.  I signed the log book and my son took a trading card and left a lucky wooden nickel in the cache. p B. Jones
  -  This one took me a little while, I left then saw another cacher and we went back to find it and he found it for us. I took a matchbox, key chain, spong bob, and a book. We left a baby cd, a couple of hair bows, and a pen. A good find, THX.
  -  This was the fourth cache find of the day. We had a great day at Cochran Mill Park. BTW, X DOES mark the spot. we took a whistle and bungee cords, left a Spiderman Pez, Pokemon and signed the log. The search took 41 minutes from Cache Me In A Can  we stopped to play with a turtle. 
  -  Out doing some out of home territory caches today with AG southwest of Atlanta, with high hopes of making it down to Brookstone, but we didnt have enough time.  Nonetheless, really enjoyed my first visit to this park.  Check out the pic AG took of the path through the greenery   that entire area looked like a sea or carpet, pretty cool!  Anyways, AG took 14 paces that a way, while I took 14 paces not quite that away, and she spied it first.  Nice stash! Took matchbook container, left either a cat toy or visor attached sunglass holder, cant remember which.  Thanks for the find, Solar! 
  -  Second find of the day with Cymbaline. What a nice leasurely stroll down this quiet park path on a cloudy sunday! The coordinates were surprisingly accurate for a wooded area and we found the cache with no problems. It was exactly 14 of my paces from the X. Took the dice set and bandaids. Left a coaster set, highlighter pen and beads. Thanks for a great cache location and the smiley! ~AG
  -  Out for the day with my brother, ErnieB.  This was second find of the day.  Nice area for a cache.  I spotted the cache first, its always a game with us.  Had lots of fun but day was getting really hot!  Thanks for the cache.  Took paper hole punch and left set of 4 bungee cords.
  -  Went with MeMe5, my sister, to this one as well as cache me in a can in the same park. Had a little trouble deciding which way was west and south, since I forgot to bring my compass. TNLN.
  -  Went with solar to check on the cache. Nice day for a walk. 
  -  Came to Cochran Mill Park today to look for this cache and two others. Cache Me In A Can & Between a Rock And a Hard Place Parked at the nature preserve by mistake, so had to cross the creek and the road to found the caches. Found all three caches! A nice different touch to this one with the cache being a few paces from the coord location. One more beautiful place found by the GPS. See Pictures  Thanks, Atlanta Highland Bagpiper
  -  Found in January with Peachteach
  -  7th and final one of the day. I seen where the name of this cache came from. I enjoyed the walk and the hunt for this one it was a really nice day. I took the 2 AA batteries and the Euro coin. I left a poncho and a Bic Magic Marker.
  -  Came all the way from germany, europe, to find this one. br This was the 2nd cache of the day. br Nice walk and beautiful area. The cache is in very good shape. br Made a log in the book. Took out the disposable emergency poncho and left a 2 EURO coin. br

  -  Great hike...The kids had a great time running down the trail and over the bridge.  Such a great day to be out hunting for treasures.  Thanks for the hunt. p Ruel33...With Devin and Haley
  -  This was a real hike for us.  We went cross country from X almost and that was a mistake! We climbed over a mountain instead of walking on the nice path which we found to come back on. Great hide in a gorgeous area which was totally new to me!  I took my son in law and his two boys and they are hooked on the sport now!
  -  F ATabor and I had a great walk while looking for this cache. It was very peaceful and scenic. I would definitly recommend this one for beginners and veterans alike. Took Mickey ears and left lizard. br CptTabor
  -  This one was closer to the X than I thought at first. The only thing is this park is closed on Sunday and had to walk a long way. The gate on the side was open at first and several people milling around so we walked back and when we came out the gate was locked, good thing we didnt drive back there.
  -  Nice area. Hit this cache in the pouring rain. The last cache that we hit that involved an X was Hortons Hideaway. Thankfully, this cache was not nearly as mind blowing as that classic cache. Took nothing, left nothing. Signed log book.
  -  Enjoyed the hike and the scenery.  Very nice spot.  Thanks so much...see ya on the trail.. p Took a dalmation puppy and left a dollar bill. p Thanks  Jess Wade
  -  Wow! This was our first official cache using our GPS, on our own, without a guide. We werent sure that we had entered the correct coordinates especially when we came to the last 50 feet or so of the X. We then relied on my mothers trusty sense of direction and stick to it ness and we foudn both the X and the cache! We took the Cracker Barrel Peg Game, a Hot Wheels truck, and a small plastic cross. We left a golf ball, a Yu Gi Oh card, and a plastic lei. Thank you for a fun day. We plan to return to Cochran Mill Park to find the other two caches.
  -  Came back for the second time to get this one.  Missed by 20 feet or so last time.  Kiwi traded for some Lego and we took the travel bug.   We hike straight from Between a rock and a hard place and had a good time crossing the creeks and woods. Saw a whole bunch of deer and a group of horse backriders.  Had a real good day caching, Thanks Solar p Kiwicacher
  -  Was taking the family out to dinner in Palmetto and decided to spend a few minutes caching.  My wife had never been to this park and I thought it would be a nice way for her to check it out.  We had a nice walk and found the X but did not find the cache before we had to go, everyone one was very hungry and intrests quickly shifted to dinner. We will be back.
  -  Our beatiful Saturday wouldnt be complete without bagging at least two caches, so after getting Cache Me in a Can, we took off after X. And we did it like LZ33 did it; we hiked through the forest instead of using the gravel trails. A much better experience, we think. Came upon the location and found the clue very quickly and then decided to turn off the GPS and use our good old compass for the final search. Nicely done, solar, an A one cache. TLC Racing, kiwicacher and us think youre doing a helluva job with this sport. The Treasure Caches Salt Water Key travel bug still resides here and the cache is in great shape. We took  Sponge Bob air fresheners and whoopee cushion  my favorite . We left  surfer dude and pink lizard. Thanks for another great hunt!
  -  Thanks for a great cache.   You can tell an experienced geocacher placed this cache since he gives; walking distance, visual aids  incase of satellite interference  and has an organized container.  I took the “through the woods route,” so you can see the wild life as well as seeing some of the antiques from a past on the ground.  Took the marble travel bug and dropped off a key travel bug.   br LZ33   br 
  -  Found at 11 00 a.m. Great day for a find like this one!  Great spot.  GPS went crazy. Clues were creative. Thanks!  GA Camper
  -  Good cache! Forgot to take the cache sheet with me but remembered that X didnt quite mark the spot. After looking around a bit I found it. Took Cracker Barrel playing cards and GEO decal and left travel bug Lost my Marbles  #314674  since it would be in keeping with the kid oriented items in the cache. Thanks for the hunt!
  -  This was our first time using GPS and was a great experience.  Good first time out cach.  We had the clues for caches in the area and used the wrong clue for this cach.  We found the x without a problem.  We arrived at the X and began looking for a buried cach from another clue.  What dummies we were, we looked for about 15 minutes then realized what we were doing.  Had a good laugh and went on to the second cach.  We learned to keep cach information separate.  Thanks for making this one easy, it really increased out confidence.  Both of us enjoyed the experience.  I have been to Cochran Mill Park many times and have camped there with the scouts often.  This area needs another longer cach with several waypoints. 
  -  This was our 2nd cach of the day. Took about 5 minutes to find it. Lost the GPS signal due to the heavy tree cover.  We had lots o fun and the kids enjoyed the playground at the end. We took the pumpkin doll and toy car and left Spot the dog and a dinosaur ruler.  br THANKS!! Tom , Bev , Caitlyn , Josh and Sandy the DOG.
  -  Found it!!  This was the second for the day in the park.  We did this one right after Cache Me in a Can.  Took the key chain tape, the flashlight and the brass whistle.  Left a Parachute Pumpkin toy, a whoopee chusion, and skull, bat and spider rings. br Thanks for the hunt. br CajunCruzer, LeopardChik, and Zebra Girl br 
  -   A HREF http   www.joedom.com  target _blank Users web page  A  br This was our 3rd of 3 caches for the day in the park.  What a great way to spend a Saturday morning with my wife Mary Catherine, daughters Alex & Tori, son Stephen, and niece Maddie.  Very easy trail and straight forward cache.  The cache was right where it was supposed to be. p Lots of goodies inside the cache box.  I let the kids trade some of the goodies they picked up in the 2 other nearby caches from inside this park.  You can see that doing that in the picture below.  Review the actual log to see what we left and took.  Nice park. p Thanks   Joe and family
  -  Located cache at 1100 hrs., had to back track a bit, I entered the coordinates wrong the first time and had a great hike in the heat and humidity, but after correcting this we walked right to it.  Took nothing and left a hooded rain poncho. p Bob & Marianne
  -  Nice scenic area. Good exercise! I took the chimp and left Ghost Chasers car. Thanks for the search!
  -  GPS sure was acting up.  Finally found the x, the rest was fairly easy.  Nice park.  Took biners, left bubbles
  -  thanks fun spot.  took georgia peach. ill log him asap! God bless.
  -  This was my second cache and certainly not the last.  I was wondering if a man who came in Barnes Store in Carrollton to buy a pair of boots was reading this?  He is the one who got me started doing this sport.  I would like to thank him for letting me know about it, so if you read this let me know your screen name.   br thanks br Gen. Lee

  -  Wow what fun that was. This one took two days only because there was a whole lot of people there so we had to go back. What a cool way to hide the cache! If I didnt have my 11 year old daughter with me I probably wouldnt have found it. Thanks for the hunt!!!!!   earle n girls
  -  Out with AG on a southside run. Second try at this one. Needed AGs eyes the first time around. br Thanks!
  -  5 of 21 p Out caching the Southside with D&L today. The final on this one is great. Excellent work on the container. I actually found it by mistake too, lol! Good job! SL, ~AG br 
  -  Well I found the first stage without any problem.  I had to break down and call out my father in law.  He showed up and I told him I zeroed out right here.  He picked up the cache 18 inches away from where I stood.  This is probably the best set of coords I have ever seen in this kind of tree cover.  
  -  This new cache has seen no activity in eight days, so I had to go check it out. I was expecting a unique Bushbob container and I was not disappointed. Nice work Bob! Thanks for the rainy day fun.

  -  Took two trips to complete but success prevailed.
  -  Finally got back out on this one. The stage one coords need to be replaced, as the elements have taken their toll. Thanks ~Martin
  -  Forgot to log this one earlier.  Thanks.
  -  I heard through the grapevine that the second part of this cache has been moved and that I should check out the new hide. The area looked a lot different than my first time here in early September. Good hide Bob.
  -  This cache has been moved and I found the new spot great place I dont think it will be muggleized again.

  -  Nice and quick multi. br Took the wooden nickle, left a front end loader. br Thanks!
  -  Nice dead area took both TB left a wooden nickle and coins thanks BB.
  -  Today  October 21, 2004  I put a new log in the cache.  Also I put two travel bugs.  Happy Hunting.  BUSHBOB
  -  Somehow between the 16th and today the cache container was opened and the log book removed   . When I found the cache today the lid was not on the ammo can properly. It was just sitting in place on top of the cache but it was not hinged properly on the back side. Since there is no log book in the cache I couldnt sign it   . As proof of my visit youll find  when you replace the log book  a green mini carabiner with my name and email address along with a CITO kit. p I replaced the lid properly before placing the cache back in the spot where I found it. TFTC!
  -  Found this nice little multistage today with AG.  As she said, we drove just about as close as we could go   park was empty except for one guy in his car talking on his cell phone?  Or something.. Anyways, I took an easier route to the cache than AG, and found it after expanding the search area a bit.  Took spare rope, left a pack of handwipes.  Thanks for the cache!
  -  4th find for the day while on a Southside caching run with Cymbaline. Nice park area. We drove the truck right to the treeline, lol. Definitely a lot of thorns on the way in, but thats what long pants are for  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_wink.gif border 0 align middle   Took travel bug. Left rain poncho and a box of colored chalk. TFTC, ~AG
  -  Added TB this A.M.
  -  Easy multi. There are many briars, and poison ivy, but they are the low growing variety and no problem. Thanks~ p #629    Martin, from Franklin, GA  img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_big.gif border 0 align middle 
  -  I ate 476 spider webs on this one.  Once I finally spotted the cache, I felt so relieved.  The GPS was not too much help in these woods.  Nice hide, enjoyed it. p Jess Wade
  -  My GPSr did not seem very useful today, but I wandered around till I found it. I had the place to myself due to the rain. Thanks.

  -  My GPS didnt cooperate with me on this cache.  I started off looking in an area at least 100ft off even though my GPS read 2ft from the coordinates.  Eventually, it starting pointing over in the right direction and after some extensive searching I found the cache.  Thanks for the cache.
  -  It took me a little bit to find this one.  The coords took me to the creek.  Thanks for the walk. LZ33

  -  Fifth of fourteen on a southside blitz with AG. Couldnt find it til we tripped over it! br Thanks!
  -  5th find on the day while caching with Dougs94 & Linda. This one was a lot tougher than it had to be. We spent way longer than the 5 minutes it took Nasty George to find it. p Even with his extra hint, it took us nearly a half hour to locate this one. The North coordinate for the final was pretty off for me. I took a waypoint average of 130 readings at the final and will email you that coord in case you decide to update and average with your original. SL and listened to a few trains go by. Thanks, I think. ~AG 
  -   I found the cache 5 minutes and 20 seconds after arriving at the vicinity  I didnt have a pencil so I was not able to log in. The railroad spike in the base of a tree near the cache box is actually a benchmark and could probably logged in as such. It is actually a temporary bench mark used in the grade control when the park was built. Good cache but the ngrs is a 3.5. I will explain the rating system on a future post on the Ga Geocachers Board. br thanks ng  
  -  Same as solar. Thanks Andy.
  -  We got lucky and found this one much quicker than the other two Maviman caches nearby. Thanks for the outing.
  -  Waited until afternoon to give Solar a chance at this one.  Andy this is your best, kid, you are getting better at hiding these caches.

  -  An easy find on a very hot day.  Cache was out in the open so we replaced it with a little cover.  Then we went shopping in the mall!
  -  Was just here yesterday and didnt realize there was a cache here till this morning.  Found with no problems
  -  THANKS FOR THE HUNT br L SIG CARD
  -  quick easy one.  
  -  Found on a day of caching in Monroe and surrounding counties.  #8 of 20. br All the action must be over.  Didnt see any birds or babies. br TFTC br 
  -  Dad let me grab this one today.  Hey...the babies have been born.  The proud momma and pappa are still pretty worked up.  Ill post a pic soon. br Signed the log. br Strohem
  -  Got attacked my the birds.  They wanted to play and I wanted to get the cache and get out.  Finally did and the birds where happy when I left.
  -  Hey, PP!  We stopped by Richards  we know him by Dick, heh heh  and parked right next to the cache.  Little did we know you had the place guarded!  Ooo RAH!  She didnt want us around, and I saw why!  Go, babies, go!
  -  TNLNSL TFTC  Loved the birds but they didnt like us.
  -  Went back and snagged this quick one. br Thanx, br BBF
  -  Running in the rain with Deermark, PrairiePartners and KepNFit.
  -  Hit on a rainy caching day in the Bloomington and Bedford areas. p  br Kepnfit br Team Dragon Along br Jeffersonville, IN
  -  Thanks for the hide. These birds are used to be upset. We had one nesting in our yard once. p Deermark
  -  made a mother bird upset. 
  -  Didnt see others logs about bird before going and didnt see updated hint. Bird was really freaking me out thought he had gotten hit in the head or something till we read the other logs will go back and find it later.
  -  Our resident bird must have been taking a break this morning, did not see the fine feathered friend. Thanks for the find.
  -  Updated hint so finding cache would be super easy. Cache is far enough away from nesting bird if cacher uses new hint will not upset bird. ALL please use caution around nesting bird.
  -  I went to do this one and a bird was nesting on the ground right by where the GPS was pointing.  I really upset the bird setting on the nest, so I left without trying to find the cache.  Please archive or at list disable the cache for a while to let the Killdeer nest in peace.  What a strange place to nest.  
  -  I dont know if the eggs are now birdies, but the momma sure was very vocal about me being there.  I gave her as much room as possible, signed the log and moved along as not to upset her more.  br Nice hide, thanks! br Carla & Mark br Lost N Looking
  -  Nice hide!
  -  Found this one this morning. Beware of birds in the area gaurding their young.
  -  Traditional caches are great but grab and go micros can be fun too if done well!   THANKS FOR THE HIDES!!!
  -  I found this one just like I would like to this morning, with my coffee in one hand, my foretrex on my wrist and the cache soon in the other hand. There are three bird eggs nearby on their way to becoming birds, so cachers coming shortly after me need not check them for goodies. Thanks for the hide.

  -  Good hide on this cache. Enjoyed the search of the library.

  -  Found this one after a while of digging around.  The cords are close but I am not sure about the 15 feet thing.

  -  First to log but not first to find. Went back to give this another try after email from owner assured me that I was close. Found this time in less than 10 mins. Good hide!! Was easier at night though!! Someone did beat me to cache, maybe I should have not given up too easy last time. found at 12 05 am. Thanks for hiding caches here in Bloomington. Keep it up!! TNLNSL p Prairiepartners
  -  FTF? Original coords. brought us to a bench about 15 ft. from cache. After a 30 minute search under a hot summer sun, we were greeted by the cache owner who provided us with the additional hint found above. TN Left dart flights TFTC. BBF then gave us the coords for  Oh Canada cache. We enjoyed the walk with BBF and his brief history lesson of IU. Alway nice to meet a fellow cacher on the trails.
  -  This one is still there. I was there half the day today and all day yesterday. I can tell you that the mulchers wouldnt be most likely not be bothering this cache. br Prairepartners brought it to my attention that the coords for the bench might be off. Will check them again tomorrow. When establishing the cache I took them at least nine times. Maybe I need to do it another nine. br TTFN
  -  Gave this one over an hour of my time so I can reasonably post a DNF. GPS wouldnt settle on any one bench so I really searched good around 2 of the benches. Coords kept taking me towards front of library computer area, however, there wasnt any benches there. I did search all around all 6 benches, so the cache must be extremely well hidden. They have been mulching in the area so I hope all is still well. I would be glad to get with any other cachers that would like to search get heads together on this on.  p Prairiepartners br Williams, IN
  -  Thought I would stop by and check on this one since no one has found it yet. p Cache was sobbing uncontrollably from loneliness    br I picked it up and dusted it off.  Wonder how the camo was off  br considering no one has found it. Hmm imagine that a 3x4in. container lying on the ground and no one can find it.  p Hint#2  You must get off your computer to go look for it. Oh yeah dont think so hard. p 
  -  Third of four DNFs for weekend while visiting Bloomington on trip from Naples, FL for wedding of niece.  I looked for over forty five minutes with no luck, and had to get moving as I wanted to find a few caches before I headed back to Florida.  My GPS has been off all weekend so not sure where to look on most caches.  My southern GPS must not work up north.  I see others have had problems, so I dont feel so bad.  I wish I had the new cache page as it would have given me a location to look for.  My cache page had no mention of a bench.  Sorry that I cant come back a look for this one.   – Pittsburgh Transplant      p  This entry was edited by Pittsburgh Transplant & Tag A Long on Monday, May 30, 2005 at 7 07 22 AM. 
  -  Ok, I looked for this one on a sunday late afternoon during the least amount of traffic. Still I was being watched by patrons of the computer labs with puzzled faces. I found a spot, but no cache. I spent the better part of an hour on this, I dont give up very easly, but I did on this one.  br Eamon111
  -  Since no one has found this yet I will explain that the difficulty is a result of how many places there are too look as well as the disguise. My gps stinks so I didnt want to put exact coordinates but I think its pretty close.
  -  Agree with Steve.  We did not find this and while we are not the best cachers by any means we couldnt figure it out.  The spot it brings you to is interesting but where it looks like it would be wouldnt put me at D+4.  We searched them and couldnt find it.  We must have just missed it.
  -  I didnt find a cache at the coordinates  where there are plenty of difficulty 1 hiding spots , and my instincts tell me that what I did find point to a puzzle offset or mystery cache. If the cache is at the posted coordinates, Ill have to think through what kind of hiding method would raise the difficulty such.

  -  It is still soaked... I put a new piece of paper in there, but unfortunately I had no plastic pouch to put it in, so it will probably get soaked too, soon. I guess I should have read the previous log before going for this cache...

  -  This was the perfect resting spot so I decided to take advantage of the shade and let the little ones do the hard work for a change. They soon brought me the cache. Thanks for leading us to an area where I could take a brief nap!!

  -  1 45pm on Fri 29Apr05   slight rain br We think we found the cache location without finding cache. Clue and coordinates makes location unmistakeable. Noted that cache was replaced last fall during football season and high tailgating events. But in the spring   gone? Maybe we werent clever enough? br ForestnFrances with Bullthistle and Tansy br 
  -  Last cache of the day...Met a woman in the park who was letting her puppy run free.  BC seemed to really enjoy playing with Murray, so we let her off her leash to run as well.  They loved it!  Unfortunately, another dog came through the park, they were leashed, and when they were both let off their leash again, they both ran. ACK!  So, we ended up chasing after them trying to get them to stop.  Finally they did, and we were able to resume caching.  p Found this one quite easily.  Left a Webling in the cache and took nothing.  p Thanks for taking us to this park! p Bear and Ting and BC too

  -  10 50 EST br The park was deserted today, but I can tell by the numerous fire rings that dot the area that things can be pretty busy on game days. I found a signature card in one potential hiding spot and was worried that the cache had been plundered, but I looked around for a minute and found the cache elsewhere. br 
  -  Nice park and a nice easy find.  Thanks.  
  -  Found this last month, but just logging it now. I was impressed that this cache has survived in such a high traffic  or high debauchery  area. Guess everyones too busy tail gaiting to spot the cache.
  -  Cant believe this doesnt get tossed more often consdering the location! TNLN, no pen so didnt sign  duh . TFTC

  -  Replaced cashe today and put a TB in the container, hope it doesnt disapper too quick with the game tomorrow.
  -  We didnt find the cache, all we found was a geocaching card.  Maybe the tailgaters got ahold of the rest of it.
  -  Found 3 great spots that even fit with the clue. One spot I found a Bud Light can that I left there. Second spot I found a shiny penny and left it there. Third spot on a different tree was the clue on the ground and a hiding spot where I put my signiture card covered with tree debris. My GPS died as I hit zero feet, but I looked for another 20 minutes. Here from Grand Rapids MI for my cousins wedding.
  -  Guess this one left to stay at MSU...
  -  Found this cache along with the Rinckels and my wife, collectively known as Olde Kynge Cole and His Married Olde Souls. We took the travel bug and left a waterproof match box. Beautiful day for a walk and geocaching.

  -  My GPS was pointing directly at a different spot that fit the description. However, after thoroughly checking this out, we spreaded out and my son found it! Nice hiding place. Took carabiner and left peacock feather.
  -  We decided wed better stop by this one before the football season begins.  Its hard to imagine this quiet, beautiful place beset by crowds of tailgaters.  Mr. tracks showed me where he used to perch way up high in the stadium to take football game pics.  T golfball. L biner.  Thanks.
  -  Nice cache, though we were harassed by a squirrel that was feasting on tree fungus. I didnt know squirrels ate fungus. ^_^
  -  Nice place! Clue was initially misleading because it applies to more than one tree. p Left the Happy Valley Helmet TB, which is trying to visit all the Big 10 schools. Got IU!

  -  In town overnight so had to seek some local caches.  Found the cache a little northwest of the posted coordinates.  TNLN    THANKS!

  -  14 15 EST br At first, the GPS led me about 70 feet down the hill, which I knew from the description couldnt be right, but after about a minute it settled down and the coords were right on the spot. Found this one quickly despite all the traffic. I see what you mean about that bridge.
  -  Another find with BJ&Snurt.  TNLN  Thanks for the hunt.
  -  Caching down 107 Tuckasegee River Valley.  Visiting big fat pipe, big pipe, power grid and finally....Power Plant.  Our caching group is not fooled.  We know now and have confirmed that these pipes carry Coca Cola from cola wells high in the Appalachians to this huge brick building that is labeled as a power plant.  We found a leak in the pipe and drank our fill of coke.  All now know that this is a coca cola botteling plant.  Ok, we concede that the coke first rushes down the pipes, through the turbines generating electricity and carbonation for the bottling process.  Found cache between cola belches.  We had a great time on this cache.
  -  This cache survived the flood waters of Frances but could not survive Ivan! The bridge that this cache was hidden near had the support pylons swept from under it. I have hidden a new cache in a different location, still near the power plant but further from the bridge area. I recommend folks stay away from the bridge as it is likely to be unstable!
  -  Hummmmmmm... nice hiding place, did not drop it into the water.  Traded something small for something tiny.  TFTH.
  -  FTF br we have been here before on a wild goose chase. cache was fairly visible.

  -  Used the clue cool box, cool place.
  -  Another plesant find on my day out with Geophil.  Thanks!
  -  Unfortunately, I know my son in law, OzGuff, much too well so I spent more time than necessary looking down storm sewers, under light standards, inside electrical boxes, etc. before heading to the more obvious nooks.  The paint color on this cache works very well to hide it from the muggles.
  -  Thanks for the great hide!

  -  Found with Dear Dora on the way to the Inky Stinky cache event. It was late in the afternoon, so the temp was dropping. Glad there were no muggles around,  it musta been too cold for them...  so finding the cache was not too difficult.  Signed the log and high tailed it back to the car...
  -  After an expensive stop at Highland Hiker we found this one. 9 of 12 for the day br SL
  -  Too bad it was so cold today.  This seems like a nice spot to just stop and watch the people pass by.  Atrus and I make quick work of locating the cache and signing the log. Brrr!
  -  We landed at The Country Cottage late this afternoon, for the InKy Stinky caching weekend, and met up with fellow GEOSET cachers and cabin cohorts, CarolinaMOOn & Unwilling Crew. After we corraled our caching gear back into the geo mobiles, we headed out for jombbls first caching trek in North Carolina, along nearby Lake Glenville and Cashiers.  We walked over from Cashiers Trail, dodging traffic, dipping, and making friends with a local cat along the way.  CarolinaMOOn found the cache while the rest of us were looking in the wrong places. We signed the log and then realized that Nature Walk was closer than the car, so we walked over to it. br Blair & Chip

  -  Nice hide, this area looks like its being relandscaped. TFTC!
  -  Let me just say that 3 miles as the crow flies seems like it is a lot closer than 3 miles on a windy mountain road behind a dump truck. I had to get one more and this seemed like the best one. Quick grab then off to Hendersonville.

  -  The Summit Charter School Geocachers were out today on their first hunt of the new semester. After getting familiar with the GPS units we hit this cache first. After 10 minutes of searching Barrett was the finder! He took the Ford keyring.  OzGuff promised to bring something to leave in the cache!  We decided that since the group is comprised of different students we can find caches multiple times.
  -  After the three caches at Whiteside Mountain and one on Lake Cashiers, this one was a walk in the park! TNLNSL, thanks for the break! br

  -  In route home to the New Orleans area from Brevard and stopped to grab a cache or two along the way.  We saw a band setting up as we went for this one.  Ran a diversion taking photos of nearby flowers.  Then spent some money in a nearby shop. Thanks for the hunt.  Happy Trails, Team Bamboozle
  -  Our 1st of 12 for the day  and they were all OzGuffs!  We got a late start leaving Brevard so Laughing Moon and I told ourselves that we would do what we could and still rush back to Brevard by 7 pm in order to have dinner with friends. br    I had a pretty good idea where we would find this one and sure enough my hunch proved correct.

We were lucky because about 10 minutes after we found the cache a band began setting up near the cache! p                                         Thanks! br                          Wanderlust and Laughing Moon

  -  It was pretty funny watching DaringDiva and AdventureChick exploring the area with the band playing!  They would listen to the music, snapping their fingers looking like groupies and casually looking up and down until the cache was found.  This was very entertaining!

  -  Took the Summit Charter School Geocachers out on this years first hunt. The kids had a ton of fun with the three caches they found today!

  -  HOORAY!!! WE WERE FIRST TO FIND for this cache, our first FTF. Not a hard one, given the title. Surprised someone else had not already zeroed in on this one. We had tried looking for an earlier cache at this general location, but it was gone so we were glad to come back to the area and find a replacement.

  -  The answer is Jan 1979 Alaska became a state. br How many states border Massachusetts and what are they?
  -  Found at 15 30 SL the name was a life saver as the GPS had me all over the area but where it should have sent me. br Spent more time trying to find the street than finding the cache.
  -  One of several we found today. To answer gotro&hcs question, a single star.  br My question is, name the month & year Alaska became a state.  p TFTH TNLN SL br 2 Wingers

  -  No luck finding this cache today.   img src http   www.geocaching.com images icons icon_smile_sad.gif border 0 align middle   Suppose Id shood have payed more ttention in skool!
  -  Was going to grab this and ATV but a truck was parked in the only pull off area I could find.  Went and snagged ATV and came back, but the truck was still there.  Decided to leave this one for another visit.
  -  My intent with the question part of this cache is that cachers learn about topics they may not be familiar with. I have added a requirement that the question be of educational value.  This is to stop questions like How old am I?  p Please make your question about some area that you know well so that we can all learn!  See    geocaching CAN BE about something more than just finding plastic boxes in the woods!  p FYI    I now know how many stars are on the Bonnie Blue Flag!  Look like dis hoem skoolin be workin!

  -  Curious college frat boys all around! This would have been much worse in the fall.  It took a little stealth, but I found it quickly and undetected.

  -  Cache back online. Moved it slightly; changed the coords and clue.

  -  This area was hard for us to locate without local maps.  We finally asked some kids about where it might be located and they told us about the construction area.  When we arrived at the court, nobody was in sight.  We spent 20 minutes looking around without any clue where it might be.  The GPSr had us in the middle of the court.  Then we looked at the hint and spent another 45 minutes looking in vain.  I would say this is a tough hide but we havent been too good at finding many of the micros in the area.  Im sure we overlooked this one as well.  At least some quys came out before we left and I had the chance to shoot some hoops before it started raining.  Thanks for another challenging cache.
  -  This visit by the INKY team, and a subsequent visit on the 27th failed to turn up the cache.  Sorry about that.   Danny of TeamArgo
  -  Found with dad and Tahu.
  -  Found with dad and OzMeg.
  -  It was depressing to see a once beautiful area despoiled by cruddy looking institutional structures.  These are actually reminiscent of the PANOPTICON prison structures envisioned by Jeremy Bentham of the Utilitarian school.  NO JOKE!  Doubly discouraging was the damage done to trout habitat to the west...I guess I dont see growth as an benefit in this case. Why couldnt the campus go up instead of out?  PAVE PARADISE, PUT UP A PARKING LOT. p HC

  -  I signed in and headed for Granny Burrell Falls cache.  After I found that one, I decided to go after the two I missed on Wednesday.  Ended up hiking to the East entrance.  Made my way back stopping at School House Falls for some pictures.  Total trip about 7.5 miles.
  -  Found this without any trouble and signed in. I came here to start the Your Choice Cache. Thanks for the hide.  p Nuwati
  -  Dropped by to add two GC.com stickers to the cache container.
  -  Creative!!!!We did quite a bit of looking...
  -  We agree this one needs a stamp to show exactly what it is. A very creative cache!
  -  A good warm up cache.  It would be nice if there was a geocache sticker somewhere so that you would be sure that you have in fact found it. br The Roberts Family, Bones, Angie, and Lucy
  -  Found with family.  On my birthday! 
  -  Wow!  An FTF with the family.  You may want to contemplate whats in a name?

  -  Hit the cache on a 4 day caching trip to North Carolina and South Carolina with the InKy Caching Group from Southern Indiana and Kentucky.  p Glad we had Young Turtle AKA the Vertical Retriever, with us.

  -  Piece o cake.  Then I died. p What a trip! What a cache! Did this along with many other great caches with the INKY team. The area is highly recommended! p ARF br Louisville, KY
  -  After doing Yosemite this one was a breeze. Kepnfit is younger but I did notice him dropping back on the climb to the final spot of the Yosemite multi. Younger is not always better. Thanks. p Deermark br INKY group
  -  I did this cache with the INKY group from Indiana and Kentucky. It was one of many that were hand picked for us and was, like our entire experience during this trek, very enjoyable. What a setting for geocaching! p Neat spot for a cache!  I wish my GPSr had swung around earlier to put me in a position to have found it before the crowd.  Thanks! p Lumberjack Tom br Louisville, KY   br 
  -  Well I had to bale on my InKy clan on this one, but I was with them in spirit. I did get to place my hand on the container before it was placed in its home. br 
  -  I really hope people in N.C. still realize what beauty they have all around them. It is so easy to get get caught up in every day life and forget to look around.  p Thanks for showing us your area, In 4 days we saw, via geocaching, what would have taken us 20 years worth of vacations to see otherwise. Cant wait to see the rest of it. p Shonky corrds or not we had a great time even after an occasional shellacking. br Ta Cobber. br Goodonyermate!
  -  I was here guiding the INKY crew through Panthertown. I replaced the HIGH OVER GREENLAND cache with this cache  and then let the INKY crew beta test it .

  -  With MXCR we got this one in our hands quick. And moved on to the final stage of this series of caches on Caney Fork. br LL100
  -  This was the final piece of the puzzle that we needed to go to the Final Caney Fork #5.  We got this one pretty easy, except for one small copperhead, it was a routine find.  The view from this area is outstanding. It seems that we are the FTF on #2,,#3,,and #4.  Ill move the TB on, the cache was so full that there wasnt much room for him.  Took rain poncho and left a biner. TFTC.  MXCR
  -  Took the BRP today specifically to see if you could hike down to this cache. It was a very easy stroll. Dropped the Jimmy Vasser bear into the cache.  Which is now incredibly full! 
  -  Original contents  logbook and pens, rain poncho, jump rope, deck of cards, pink survey tape, screwdriver set, Play doh activity pack, measuring tape, 2 clips, smiley face game.
