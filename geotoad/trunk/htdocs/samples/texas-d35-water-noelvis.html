This is a smaller ammo container just off a beaten track near Cottonwood Creek. The coordinates lead directly to the cache, but, you will want to follow the following instructions as the cache is now (once again) locked! Before you go after this cache, you will want to have the combination of the lock attached to the box and obtaining the combination will require a bit of footwork. The lock is a standard Master brand lock. To open it, spin the dial at least 3 revolutions clockwise, stopping at the first number. Then, spin the dial anti-clockwise one entire revolution, continuing until the second number is landed upon. Finally, spin the dial clockwise, stopping at the third number. The lock should now open. The first number may be obtained by standing on the sidewalk at 33 07.007 x 096 39.538. The observer will find him/herself between two concrete power poles, one to the east and the other to the west. Choose one. There is a series of numbers in yellow against a black background on each of the poles. The two digit number you want are the last two digits on the top line of either pole. The second number is on a brass historic marker near the point 33 07.012 x 96 39.862. The historic marker tells something of the dam down by the creek. The dam in view was under water for dozens of years because of a dam built downstream in 19XX. Find the value for XX and you have your second number. Finally, stand in the middle of a bridge. The bridge is in the park at 33 06.796 x 96 39.700. You would be twice unlucky were you to stand there very long. To find your number, count the number of little arches on one or the other side of the bridge and deduct the amount of the second number. You should arrive at your third number. Others before you have found this cache and have enjoyed seeking the combination. I would hope that you will, too. Have fun and enjoy!</p>

A fellow geocacher noted some fresh "No Trespassing" signs posted near the site. Apparently, it was located in someone's hunting lease. Anyway, the new location is probably more rewarding than the original, so those who have already visited, please come again! <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 From Houston, travel north on Hwy 249 to Hwy 149. Continue north through Montgomery TX (northwest of Conroe). Proceed on 149 north about 13 miles to FM 1375. Proceed east on FM 1375 about 6 miles to Forest Route (FR) 204 [30 31.668N, 95 39.239W]. Proceed south (right) on FR 204 to FR 248 [30 29.732N, 95 38.339]. Proceed on FR 248 until it ends at 30 29.900N, 95 36.531W. Park here. Proceed down trail to the fork in the path at 30 29.837N, 95 36.234W. Start looking. While you are there, enjoy the view of the lake and note all of the birds. Here you can spot a red-cockaded woodpecker. This woodpecker was added to the endangered species list in 1970, but has populated the Sam Houston National Forest. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 While in the are, you should stop at the Ranger station. It is located on FM 1375 west of IH 45. The coordinates are N 30 31.820 W 95 32.184. Here you can pick up maps and brochures about the forest. </p>

The first section starts on the West end of the hiking trail with a short drive to the second part. Total hiking for both is about 4.5 miles but you get a driving break in the middle and part of the first trail follows a Forest Serv. RD so its not a hard hike. But finding the caches might take some time, I went down there three different days with two different GPS's and the forest canopy can be tricky so I decided to give you this hint look for knotholes and green string. The encrypted hint is only for the first part of the first one.

<br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 This is a multi-leg cache located in the <br>&nbsp;
Sam Houston National Forest <br>&nbsp;
 on the Four Notch Loop Trail. This is a 10 mile spur/loop off of the <br>&nbsp;
Lone Star Hiking Trail <br>&nbsp;
 just southeast of Huntsville, TX. This cache can be done in one day if you are an aggressive hiker. Otherwise you might want to break up the mileage by spending the night somewhere on the trail. There are a number of primitive areas to pitch a tent and have a campfire if there isn't a burn-ban in effect. There are no actual developed campsites but the trail itself is well marked and maintained. The 10 miles of hiking is what contributes the most difficulty to this cache especially if you attempt it in the warmer months. You can get a trail map from the <br>&nbsp;
L.S.H.T. club's map page <br>&nbsp;
. Just click on the "4NotchLoop" button to download a printable PDF file. I've made a low quality JPG file that you can print out below ( <br>&nbsp;
fig1 <br>&nbsp;
). <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 PARKING: I would recommend to park at the official trail head off of forest service road 213 at 30' 38.769 N, 095' 25.396 W, because these caches will lead around the loop trail and if you choose other parking spots you might end up walking even more mileage. This parking spot is the location of the old Four Notch lookout tower. You can see the leg foundations around one of the concrete slabs in the area. If you are into benchmark hunting this tower location is benchmark PID <br>&nbsp;
BL2177 <br>&nbsp;
 ( <br>&nbsp;
fig2 <br>&nbsp;
). <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 HIKING: Four Notch Loop will take you through the typical East Texas terrain that you've experienced around other caches in the area. You'll walk through tall stands of pines, meandering creek beds lined with deciduous hardwoods, and through low lying floodplains of palmetto and ferns. Boswell Creek is one of the obstacles that you'll encounter twice along the trail. There used to be a bridge (30' 38.676 N, 095' 23.496 W) on the lower section but it got washed out by the frequent flooding. Thus you are going to have to ford the creek during the wet season. During the drier times it should just be a hop over to the other side. As of 2/7/2003 there is a large tree laying across Boswell in the upper section of the trail ( <br>&nbsp;
fig3 <br>&nbsp;
). This is a great way to get across until it dies or washes away. I would estimate an average time of about 5.5 hours just to hike the entire loop without taking into account any time spent searching for the cache stages. A flashlight might be of help if you don't plan accordingly. <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 CACHING: The first cache contains the coordinates to the second cache; the second to the third; and the third to the final cache. The first three caches have some extra batteries, but they don't have enough room for trade goods. In the final cache I have enclosed a log journal, a disposable camera, and plenty of trade goods. Please leave a journal entry and snap a picture of yourself. The disposable camera is not a prize so please return it into the cache container. I will periodically develop the film and post the images on this webpage. As a special prize for completing this cache, I've included a custom made patch ( <br>&nbsp;
fig4 <br>&nbsp;
). Everyone in your party is welcome to take a patch, even if you have nothing to leave. I think you've earned it!! By the comments and request of the first few seekers I ought to warn you to bring some extra supplies to aid in obtaining one of the caches. A rope might be needed. <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 CAMPING: If you want to stay overnight on the trail I have a couple suggested spots that are super cool. The first is kind of far off the trail, about a mile or so, but is definitely worth looking into. There is an old logging road that you need to find that leads directly to the spot without having to bushwack. This road hits the Four Notch Loop at 30' 39.151 N, 095' 23.138 W and leads off in a south by southeast direction into a young forest of pines. Follow that road to 30' 38.636 N, 095' 23.185 W, and bring a fishing pole. I've made a map of this old road for those who wish to print it out ( <br>&nbsp;
fig5 <br>&nbsp;
). Another nice camping spot is at hidden lake. It is labeled on the Four Notch Loop trail map and the easiest access road off the trail comes in from the north. <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 HINTS: At each cache you will get hints for the next cache you are searching for. I'll provide a printout of these hints in the caches so you can take one and decifer it whenever you want. The following hint is just for the first cache in the loop. It starts with generic info and ends with specific. So you can decifer one step at a time and not spoil yourself too much. Most of the caches are only about 50 feet from the trail with the exception of the first one. <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 WARNINGS: Here are a number of things that you should take note of before you venture out for this cache. There are many insects ( <br>&nbsp;
mosquitoes <br>&nbsp;
 & <br>&nbsp;
ticks <br>&nbsp;
), arachnids ( <br>&nbsp;
spiders <br>&nbsp;
 & <br>&nbsp;
scorpions <br>&nbsp;
), poisonous snakes ( <br>&nbsp;
copperheads <br>&nbsp;
 & <br>&nbsp;
coral snakes <br>&nbsp;
), <br>&nbsp;
poison ivy <br>&nbsp;
, animals ( <br>&nbsp;
wild hog <br>&nbsp;
 & <br>&nbsp;
bobcat <br>&nbsp;
) and hunters ( <br>&nbsp;
bubba & joe bob <br>&nbsp;
) that live and dwell in these woods. Take proper precautions when hiking and prodding around in the bushes while searching for this cache. Wear sun lotion in the sun; bug juice when its warm; neon orange clothes during deer hunting season (end of September to mid January); pants when walking through brush. Bring a lot of water to drink if you plan to hike in the summer time. <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 Regardless of the warnings this is really a safe place to hike around. I've done this loop more times that I can remember to count. Enjoy Nature!! <br>&nbsp;

I paddled to the island from the Lake Houston Marina 281-324-1264 which is right at the base of the East side of the bridge. The marina coordinates are N30-01.123 W095-07.247 It is about a mile from the ramp so is very close. The water is fiarly shallow in some parts and has a few stumps, so be careful if taking a power boat. <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 The island has a small path on the North side of it, if you climb up there you will find a clearing at the top with signs that other people have camped there before. The island apears to be man made, I don't know any other history behind it (would like to know more though). <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 I hid the cache container behind a rock, tied to a small tree and covered it with leaves, please be careful to re-conceal it when you leave so others don't discover it. I have lost 3 caches on another island, even though they had the intro messages explaining the game. <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 If you don't have a boat, you could build one like I did -- just 2 sheets of plywood, about 20 hours of nailing and gluing, some house paint and presto you have a boat. For more info about my boat <br>&nbsp;

Full of stumps, so be careful while boating there, but still very beautiful. I met up with my friend Greg and we went to the island in his home built boat. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
The island has nice beaches all around the perimeter, and even a cove on the south side. We aproached the island from the north west side, and landed close to where the land slopes down to meet the water. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Did a little bush whacking to get into the interior of the island, and we found a clearing with a large fallen tree. You will need a machette to get there. Watch out for all the thorny and itchy plants. There isn't a defined path to the cache, and the outline has drastically changed since the Mapquest maps were drawn, so just find a place you can walk into the interior.<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Heard that someone had released some feral hogs on the island, and there are also armadillos, but we didn't see any that day. On the way back we saw a beautiful bald eagle. It had a branch in it's talons and guessing it was off to build a nest. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
The container is attached to a string, and then tossed into the bushes behind so it rests at about eye level. Please be careful to re-conceal the cache, I have lost a couple of caches on other islands and hope this one lasts longer. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
I put in at a private community ramp on the west side of the lake, but the public one I would use is Wolf Creek Park just a couple miles north of where I went from. The cache is 5.65 miles from there. The park charges $4 per car and $2 per person to launch there. <br>&nbsp;

Was it the ancient design or the mystical carvings which first absorbed your interest? It's difficult to remember. Nevertheless, one thing is certain; the mirror absorbed you. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
As your former memories are fading, you begin to gather new ones'wait, not memories, but voices whispering in your head. Ignoring the voices, you attempt to return through the portal, only this time, the portal is truly only a mirror and denies you passage. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Lost and unsure about yourself, the only remnants of your memories are now the new voices. Although a jumbled mess, you believe they may be telling you of a way to return through the portal. After a few moments of listening, you begin to realize you must travel on a quest in order to find your way home. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Off in the distance, toward the South, you see another mirror lurking over the river. It must be a good place to start, or even possibly, finish. After a short stroll, you arrive at the second mirror. Fortunately, it appears you might be able to pass through this one, but something inside advises you the destination will not be your home. Taking heed, you decide not to lose your bearings more by traveling through this particular mirror. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Between the first portal and the current, you notice a pathway which heads both East and West. Beginning at a spot on the path directly between the two portals, you travel fifty squares in the direction the sun rises (for some reason you remember this small fact). <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
After the short journey, you notice another mirror directly East of where you are standing. Distant and secluded in the dark, this mirror appears to be the next plausible stop on your quest. Terror courses through your soul as you realize this next mirror is only a shadow of the previous two. This mirror definitely appears to function no longer and will unfortunately provide little assistance in returning you home. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Suddenly, the voices in your head scream and tell you to follow a crow's path toward a tall structure made by the Earth. This structure, which is the same color as the first two mirrors through all seasons, is only slightly further East on the path you were walking. (Note, there are two ways to get there'one requires a test of dexterity, and the other requires you to double-back just a little). <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Before departing, you make a mental note of the distance between this portal and the previous, so that you might be able to retrace your steps later. Crossing the treacherous river once more, you enter what appear to be the wastelands of this world. Although dangerous to maneuver, you continue your path towards the far side of the structure you seek. Once arriving at this peak, you look back over your journey and ponder how much distance you covered between your current location and the shadowed portal. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
As you rest, you begin to wonder if you will ever find your way home, when you finally realize the journey is the solution. The key to finding your way home is at the following location: <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
N32'46. A B C' <br>&nbsp;
W97'27. X Y Z' <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
A = The number of times you hopefully got wet while trying to cross the river. <br>&nbsp;
B = The number of mirrors you visited on your quest. <br>&nbsp;
C = The number of normal places to sit at the location of the third mirror. <br>&nbsp;
X = The sum of the distance you mentally kept track of, rounded to the nearest 100 feet. <br>&nbsp;
(This total should be within about 25-30 feet of a nearest 100. If for some reason you are showing around 45 to 55 feet from the nearest 100, simply round up). <br>&nbsp;
Y = The number of times the voices asked you to travel West. <br>&nbsp;
Z = The number of blue lines you crossed while walking from the second to third mirror. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
By following the signs you saw along the way, you approach the moguls at the peak of the wastelands in search of an equilateral trinity of stones. Within this trinity, you will find the answer you are looking for (please read the first page of the log book for how to return home). <br>&nbsp;

OOGIE BOOGIE&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 Well, well, well, what have we here?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
 Sandy Claws, huh?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
 Oh, I'm really scared&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
 So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha&nbsp;[img] <br>&nbsp;
You're jokin', you're jokin'&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;

 You're jokin' me, you gotta be&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;

 Then there's something very wrong&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
 'Cause this may be the last time now&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
 That you hear the boogie song, ohhh&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
Lock, Shock, and Barrel are up to no good again. They have kidnapped Sandy Claws and taken him to Oogie Boogie's Dungeon. Oogie Boogie is holding Sandy Claws somewhere in his hideout. You must first find Lock, Shock, and Barrel before you can find the hideout. Under Lock, Shock, and Barrel caps are letters and numbers that correspond with each other. After finding all three trick 'o treaters, you can then decrypt the coordinates for Oogie Boogie's hideout and rescue Sandy Claws. (I do know how to spell Santa Claus). Lock, Shock, & Barrel are their own little cache containers. You can trade small items and sign their log books. However you must find Oogie Boogie to log this cache as a find. <br>&nbsp;

A short hike on the old Pickett Trail. There are some spectacular views of the San Gabriel River's South Fork. ...and now for the rest of the story: Daddy Cat says the hike seemed a whole heck of a lot longer than the actual .5 km hiked. Teen Cat says this was an easy hike, (except for those really hard parts!), 11 year old Cat had no problems, except when he took a break and sat on a fire ant mound, Mama Cat says watch those steep slopes covered with live oak leaves'..makes for treacherous footing and may result in serious road rash! <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 The trail is in somewhat of a state of disrepair and the upper parts don't look like they are used often. The trail is easy to follow, but is narrow, rugged, and steep in places. This hike is not a walk in the park! Good shoes and a hiking stick recommended. Some climbing is required. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 As always, be very careful when hiking, respect nature, try not to disturb anything more than necessary, and watch out for 3 leaf poison plants. Poison Ivy is around the trails. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 The trailhead at Chautauqua Park is no longer recommended because of a trail slide and a downed tree. A better trailhead is off Scenic Drive. There is a trail off the street at 30 38.393 097 40.951. Watch the no parking signs on the west side (east side parking is OK). <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 The 1st leg is hidden within 10 feet of the trail. For safety sake, I'll tell you straight up, avoid the cliff face directly over the river unless you're an experienced rock climber! After finding the container with the new coordinates, think "Straight UP" some more and you'll find another trail that will take you the last 60 feet to your goal. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 GPS coverage is only fair on the trail, due to cliffs and trees. There is even one spot on the trail where you'll get no coverage at all (any more than that would be a spoiler - look at the clues to see why!) <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 NOTE TO FINDERS OF THE ORIGINAL: Feel free to find and log this one again. The second leg is all new and we think you'll find it a worthwhile challenge! </p>

Once upon a time...&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
There were two cachers who went in search of a treasure.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
A find that would grant both of them great pleasure. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
A treasure hidden deep in the woods along a river.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
A terrain that would make any geocacher shiver.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
A treasure that had never been uncovered or been found.&nbsp; [img] <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
The two made it to the site and set their feet upon the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
The two looked and looked, but could not find the treasure.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Which caused dismay and a lot of displeasure. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Now to keep others from experiencing their fate,&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
They chose to hide their own treasure - but wait....&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
They would have to hide something small, something difficult to find.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Something that makes you run in circles like you're losing your mind. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
One inch by four inch is the treasure you seek. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
This treasure is not for the terribly meek. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
Sawdust92 was first, and proved himself able.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
And now he sits, among the &quot;Round Table&quot; <br>&nbsp;

 <br>&nbsp;
 The Aztec culture came to power in 1370 and was conquered by the Spanish in 1519. The term AZTEC is a startlingly imprecise term to describe the culture that dominated the Valley of Mexico in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Some say the Aztec culture started in 1168 with the 'TENOCHCA' or "TOLTEC' culture, which was the name assumed by the Classic Mesoamericans. Others will tell you it began with the building of the city of TENOCHTITLAN some time between 1300 and 1375. The true Aztecs probably came from the remote north, around the early 13th century. They were migratory at first, wandering around the Mexican Valley struggling to survive. They were even enslaved once by another tribe, but revolted and regained their freedom. In the year 1325 they stopped their migratory pattern on the southwest border of Lake Texcoco as they beheld an eagle sitting on the stem of a prickly pear. He was holding a serpent in his talons and his wings were open to the sun. They saw this as an omen, announcing the location of their future city and capital, Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City. The Aztecs were both hunters and farmers, hunting animals for food and materials, as well as planting crops. The Aztec spoke Nahuatl. They did not have a written language, but did have written records. Those records, however, chiefly used a method of hieroglyphic like letter symbols. Once deciphered, it is much like our alphabet. What is important is that for over 500 years, a succession of kings brought prosperity and riches to the Aztec culture until the accession of Mocteuzma II in 1502. Despite a half century of successful growth and conquest, Aztec culture and society began to suffer disasters under Mocteuzma II. Most importantly, the reign of Mocteuzma II was interrupted by the invasion of the Spaniards under Cortez in 1519-1522. The Spaniards kidnapped Mocteuzma, held him for ransom, and eventually killed him in 1524. When the city of Tenochtitlan fell, the remainder of Mexico fell very rapidly, and the Spaniards took most of the treasures. The Aztec history is well documented, and will not be discussed further here. The secret of the Aztec Treasure, unlike the history of the Aztec culture, is somewhat cloudy and uncertain if known at all. Whispered legends and folklore spoke of a small band of Aztecs that escaped with some of the treasure. They were pursued north by the Spaniards, but the escape, and its outcome were unknown until some clues were discovered by an un-named geologist on the western slopes of the Franklin Mountains in present day El Paso, Texas. The un-named geologist (we will call him Bob Smith [bs]) at first couldn't read the clues, but in his spare time deciphered the Aztec alphabet. Bob discovered that the Aztecs passed through this area while running from the Spaniards, but never learned the full story. When Bob died, his widow turned all his geological papers over to the University. Among the papers was the original clues to the Aztec Treasure, and so the secret got out. To date, no one has found the treasure. The last clue Bob deciphered before his death was: <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 'We believe the Spaniard Army is still following us, but have camped at the Great River. (Rio Grande? bs) We are continuing north along the mountains, (Franklins? bs) and hope to lose them in the canyons. We will meet at a rally point, and from that point, we will decide where to hide. The old ones told of a cave where we might hide until the soldiers leave. (Aztec Cave? bs) We will search for that cave, but we must also find water. A small band of our warriors will fall back to delay the soldiers. We will leave signs for them to follow.' <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- <br>&nbsp;
 <br>&nbsp;
 The Rally point appears to be at the listed coordinates. If the warriors successfully delayed the soldiers, but also were killed, the signs may never have been found and destroyed. Bob did have a copy of the Aztec alphabet he deciphered, and it is included in the photo below. Proceed to the rally point, the adventure starts there. You must search for sign of the Aztecs passage. NOTE: Bring writing materials. Also keep your notes, because as you decode the Aztec information, some of the words may be similar. Also might be good to see what other caches are close-by. You might pass pretty close to a few of them. Good luck. </p>

This one is a booger. I fell into a cactus plant climbing up this wall--spent the time walking back picking the barbs out of my butt. There is also some sort of plant near the cache that doesn't like to be touched-it will sting you. Wear gloves/jeans just to be safe. <br>&nbsp;
Follow the riverbed/trail until your GPS swings to the right, then climb up. This cache is about .25 from another cache of mine, La Cuevita. <br>&nbsp;
Original contents-a gold medal that says WINNER on it, mini-kaleidoscope, mini paint set, bubbles, stickers, Easter basket, and other stuff I forgot.</p>

The cache is located at Wolf Creek Lake, across the Dam. You will have to park on the near side and walk the rest of the way. The trail starts at the top of the waterfall and goes down following the creek. In the spring and early summer when the water is flowing this is a very nice place to visit. However, the main attraction is also the main hazzard. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 Approach with CAUTION, as you will pass very close to the edge of a long drop, strait down into the shallow rocky water at the base of the falls. If you have small children with you, hold onto them untill you pass the spot. It is only a few steps. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 The difficulty of 5 is for those who dont read the hint. If you read the hint it is more like a 3. <br>&nbsp;
