		This page shows screenshots of GeoToad or it's data being used on various devices. If you've got a screenshot from your device or machine that you would like to submit, send some e-mail to <a href="mailto:geotoad@toadstool.se">geotoad@toadstool.se</a>

        <div class="hacktext"><div class="hackboxtitle">The Command Line</div>
		GeoToad has a very simple Text-User Interface, which allows
you to select your query options. When your done, just press &quot;q&quot;
and watch the magic. 

<br />
        <a href="screenshots/geotoad-cli.jpg"><img src="screenshots/geotoad-cli-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="138" border="1"></a>

<p>GeoToad runs under Windows, as well as Mac OS X, UNIX, and Linux - all
with the same fantastically dull user interface.</p>

        <div class="hacktext"><div class="hackboxtitle">EasyGPS</div>
        Once you've run a query and 
          have exported it to an EasyGPS .loc file, this is what it looks like. 
          Notice the intelligent waypoint names used. This query was generated 
          by taking all of the geocaches in North Carolina with a difficulty of 
          3 or higher.<br />

        Apple iPod</div>
        The iPod has a nifty feature: 
          It can read stored contacts! It uses the standardized VCF format, which 
          GeoToad handily outputs. Simply copy the output file to the Contacts/ 
          subfolder on your iPod, and you've now got up to 20G of geocaching information 
          at your fingertips (along with a little bit of music). How cool is that?

        <div class="hacktext"><div class="hackboxtitle">Sony-Ericsson
P800</div>
        This is the main way I use 
          my GeoToad output. If you use it to output to HTML, you can use Bluetooth 
          to transfer it to your cellphone, and read your geocaches on the go 
          with the built-in web browser. The query here is a list of all geocaches 
          that I have not done with-in 25 miles of zipcode 27513.

        <div class="hacktext"><div class="hackboxtitle">Plain Text</div>
        Plain text your thing? For 
          some devices, this may make the most sense!<br />

        <div class="hacktext"><div class="hackboxtitle">GPS Connect</div>
		You a Mac OS X user? GPS Connect makes it easy to upload and
download waypoints to your Garmin GPS unit. Here's a screenshot of it using
GPX data from GeoToad. The query was &quot;All Geocaches in North Carolina that
have not been found in 180 days&quot;.
