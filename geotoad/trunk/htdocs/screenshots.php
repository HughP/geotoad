        See the query tool in action. 
          It's running a query of all the caches with travelbugs (-b) within a 
          20 mile radius (-y 20) of the zipcode 27513, and outputting it to the 
          default EasyGPS format.<br />

        <div class="hacktext"><div class="hackboxtitle">EasyGPS</div>
        Once you've run a query and 
          have exported it to an EasyGPS .loc file, this is what it looks like. 
          Notice the intelligent waypoint names used. This query was generated 
          by taking all of the geocaches in North Carolina with a difficulty of 
          3 or higher.<br />

        Apple iPod</div>
        The iPod has a nifty feature: 
          It can read stored contacts! It uses the standardized VCF format, which 
          GeoToad handily outputs. Simply copy the output file to the Contacts/ 
          subfolder on your iPod, and you've now got up to 20G of geocaching information 
          at your fingertips (along with a little bit of music). How cool is that? 
          <br />

        This is the main way I use 
          my GeoToad output. If you use it to output to HTML, you can use Bluetooth 
          to transfer it to your cellphone, and read your geocaches on the go 
          with the built-in web browser. The query here is a list of all geocaches 
          that I have not done with-in 25 miles of zipcode 27513.

        Plain text your thing? For 
          some devices, this may make the most sense!<br />
