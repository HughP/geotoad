=============================

Requires Ruby 1.6

Sample Syntax for the CLI mode:

CLI/geotoad.rb -t 2.5 -f vcf -u helixblue -o ~/Desktop/charlotte.vcf 28272

Gets every cache in the 100 mile radius of zipcode 28272, with a terrain
score of 2.5 or higher, and that helixblue has not visited. Outputs a VCF
format file.
