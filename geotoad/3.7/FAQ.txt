Questions and Answers:
----------------------

1. How do you enable friendly waypoint id names?

    The synthesized waypoint id's are a feature named EasyName. Set
    your maximum EasyName waypoint length (16 for Garmin), and it will
    use them.


2. Geocaching Swiss Army Knife complains about the GPX format. How do I
   make them compatible?

    Disable EasyName waypoints.


3. What software can you use the GPX files in?

    Here are a few software products I have found that know about GPX
    files. If you have any to add, please e-mail thomas%stromberg.org

4. Why is there no GUI for GeoToad?

    Because we haven't gotten to it yet. There have been some
    failed projects by 3rd party users to produce one, and we are
    looking for developers to give us this capability in 4.0.

    The only requirement is that the GUI be fairly similar between
    Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux users. We're considering using
    ruby/wxWindows or Java/Swing (maybe Java/SWT) to do this.
