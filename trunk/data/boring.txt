  - 's Easter Weekend Geocaching Tour Previous stop Bond Cemetery Cache Volume Chapter I certainly came upon this geocache at an interesting time of day. The nearby marketplace was rather bustling with activity, so finding a empty spot in the car park was a potential challenge. By sheer serendipity, I was able to come upon one as another automobile was making its egress, so that potential problem came to nought. Much as the previous set of geocache hunters, my parking location lead to some extra exertion of energy as my climb up the nearby slope was in order. Once I reached the geocache site, I discerned that such a difficult path could have easily been avoided, along with any issues of parking. Nevertheless, I was quite committed to my path at that point. I managed to discern the location of the geocache rather quickly. Shortly before h, I applied pen to the log sheet to inscribe my personal ensign. I take note that the log sheet is nearly full and very likely in need of replacement within the near future. Very many thanks for the interesting geocache hunt. IOVA DELENDA EST! Next stop Office Supplies'
  - 'Found with Muther, Racer and TSC. TFTC'
  - 'Thanks ! This was like climbing Everest, but thats us. Raise the terrain or difficulty if possible! We had stubby fingers and took a second to get ahold of it. Ah, a day of geocaching. You never know what to expect, except that it will be an adventure. A geocaching trip should always start with a good plan. Our plan started out with the intention of grabbing some SW Indiana counties and Delorme pages for those challenges. Good plan, but good plans need to be flexible too. So we changed the attack plan to be a geocache numbers run. Good plan. OK, so we have files loaded on three different makes of gpsrs. We have the Midnight Patriot loaded with coolers, laptops, batteries, sunglasses, gloves, extra socks, a smelly decaying turtle, no wait, left that in the Cache Wrangler boy I wonder what that will smell like in twenty four hours when we return. We are also equipped with valid driver’s licenses, Los Lonely Boys Cd, bags of travel bugs, and a gigantic bag of cheese puffs which I don‘t think I‘ve eaten before, and now I know why…that stuff is like glue. Oh yeah, and two male geocachers. Now when Racer and I hit the road, we have a unique ability to turn off the need to stop for necessities like food and restrooms unless of course there is a cache there. Things change when you bring the male geocacher types along. Especially the year old male versions. They have unique needs, like terlets and food every twenty minutes. So our trip begins. Super_cacher has now taken possession of the explorist and with that ownership he also became possessed. Possessed by the “I know everything there is to know about geocaching” demon. He tried to usurp Racer’s job as navigator. He tried to take over my role as the one who says “what’s next” before we even have the last log sheet signed. He even took over ’s job of telling us when we needed to stop for food. But the really scary thing is that he was better at those things than we are! Yikes, what have I created?? Poor Racer was having technical and mechanical difficulties most of the afternoon, and ’s attempts to take over as lead navigator really put the pressure on her. But in the end, all things returned to normal. Racer navigated us to our personal goals getting numbers, counties, pages, and lots of cool places to visit like covered bridges and courthouses for future reference while the boys stretched out in the back seat SNORING while we made our way home. That’s ok, it left us hours to make plans for a two day trip to Southern Indiana. That’ll teach ‘em. Next stop…'
  - 'TFTC. We raised the terrain level a bit because of where we parked but found shortly after making our way there. Orale! Found with , super cacher, and . What a long, strange trip its been..... Originally we had planned to log a bunch of new counties but I decided we should just log a bunch of caches, so we didnt make it quite as far south as the original plan. Muther and I even got the boys to go with us. We encountered some obstacles and some frustration, okay not really we mostly just me, but it was a great time as always. Thanks for placing and maintaining the cache for us to find.'

  - 'Target acquired! Yeah baby! This was pretty cool. It was dark out and I could see mugglers coming from way off and they could not see me. My sister pulled up nearby and could not even see me, AND SHE WAS LOOKING FOR ME! I got to the spot easily enough but with it being dark I had to use my phone for light and passed it over a few times before I decided that it had to be; riggghhht THERE! Good cammo. Thanks for the fun. I was not too sure about all of these caches out in muggle view, but they can be fun if you are up to the challenge and pick your moment... oh, hi. Me?

  - 'Thanks for showing us this little cemetery. It appears there has been some storm damage, but I dont know how recent. It didnt obstruct or path to the cache though. Ah, a day of geocaching. You never know what to expect, except that it will be an adventure. A geocaching trip should always start with a good plan. Our plan started out with the intention of grabbing some SW Indiana counties and Delorme pages for those challenges. Good plan, but good plans need to be flexible too. So we changed the attack plan to be a geocache numbers run. Good plan. OK, so we have files loaded on three different makes of gpsrs. We have the Midnight Patriot loaded with coolers, laptops, batteries, sunglasses, gloves, extra socks, a smelly decaying turtle, no wait, left that in the Cache Wrangler boy I wonder what that will smell like in twenty four hours when we return. We are also equipped with valid driver’s licenses, Los Lonely Boys Cd, bags of travel bugs, and a gigantic bag of cheese puffs which I don‘t think I‘ve eaten before, and now I know why…that stuff is like glue. Oh yeah, and two male geocachers. Now when Racer and I hit the road, we have a unique ability to turn off the need to stop for necessities like food and restrooms unless of course there is a cache there. Things change when you bring the male geocacher types along. Especially the year old male versions. They have unique needs, like terlets and food every twenty minutes. So our trip begins. Super_cacher has now taken possession of the explorist and with that ownership he also became possessed. Possessed by the “I know everything there is to know about geocaching” demon. He tried to usurp Racer’s job as navigator. He tried to take over my role as the one who says “what’s next” before we even have the last log sheet signed. He even took over ’s job of telling us when we needed to stop for food. But the really scary thing is that he was better at those things than we are! Yikes, what have I created?? Poor Racer was having technical and mechanical difficulties most of the afternoon, and ’s attempts to take over as lead navigator really put the pressure on her. But in the end, all things returned to normal. Racer navigated us to our personal goals getting numbers, counties, pages, and lots of cool places to visit like covered bridges and courthouses for future reference while the boys stretched out in the back seat SNORING while we made our way home. That’s ok, it left us hours to make plans for a two day trip to Southern Indiana. That’ll teach ‘em. Next stop…'
  - 'ORALE! Encontrado con Racer y y Super_cacher. Gracias para todos grande el escondrijos. Gocé del día hermoso. TFTC.'
  - 'TFTC. Coords seemed a bit off but my GPSr was still acting a bit wacky. With the hint theres only a few places to look. Orale! Found with , super cacher, and . What a long, strange trip its been..... Originally we had planned to log a bunch of new counties but I decided we should just log a bunch of caches, so we didnt make it quite as far south as the original plan. Muther and I even got the boys to go with us. We encountered some obstacles and some frustration, okay not really we mostly just me, but it was a great time as always.

We did see where someone else had poked all around the bases of the two trees in the area. After looking at the picture, im not certain that we looked at the right tree, but there were three in the area of the coordinates and we looked at all three. One of them had an orienteering stake near the base. I dont know if thats recent, but im guessing it does mean additional non geocaching traffic through the area.'
  - 'We found three downed trees within the errors of the instruments but none had a cache near their bases. Maybe Well try again sometime. Im sure we were close as we found the stuff in the clues but no cache. Of course, it could have been buried deeper than we dug; either way, we didnt find it!'

  - 'Very cool find. Thanks for the cache....TNLNSL...CACHE ON!'
  - 'I found this one on bare coords after the Good Googalooga cache, so I first suspected that the clue was on a Coke can artfully hidden under the log. It turned out that the can was a recently used homemade hash bong. Maybe it was left by a cacher who was seeking consolation for not finding the cache? A little further searching in the area led me to the cache, which had a considerable amount of broken, untradable junk. I cleaned out the junk and left a geoGeorge$ for trade. Dont bother looking for the bong. I dumped it with the rest of the trash on my way out.'

Luckily we had the gps for the car and used it to make a mile hike back to the hotel to get the car and get to the store for batteries. We werent giving up on this one. Instead of walking back, we drove. Great public parking, but a little pricier than we were expecting $ The walk to the cache was beautiful, and Id imagine that lots of folks with family at the University Hospital find some peace here.

In my case, my wife and I have visit the Duke Clinics every months for years for medical treatments but we have never visited the Sarah P. Duke Gardens. We didnt even know this oasis was here! But this time I brought my GPS, and figured Id look for some out of state caches during our visit.

I think the parking situation has changed since this cache was first posted. Perhaps someone local could post an appropriate parking suggestion and email to cache owner so they can update the cache page with current info and people wouldnt feel as awkward parking in maybe the wrong spots. Seems everything everywhere near had some sort of permit only or designation code requirement. Not sure if we found a good spot to park or not, but we found a very empty and unused street side section without any obvious parking signage and managed ok. Found cache after a little searching, but after reading the hint walked right to it. Beautiful gardens and peaceful spot. Team Rovery_d'

  - 'After an unsuccessful hunt for Hugos Garden Cache, we had a much better time finding this one. This is not really the time of year to visit the Gardens, of course, but the unseasonably warm weather drew lots of folks to the area. Excellent day to be outside, unless youre a GPS satellites were not cooperating at all, and we had to rely on our wits some. A woman came near walking her cat, and we pretended to be having a romantic couple moment until she went on her way and we could finish up our geocaching business.'
  - 'Couldnt find it without the clue, though we were close! Log is a bit damp.'
  - 'Staying at Rolling View Campground in the Falls Lake Recreation Area for the weekend, geocaching was the name of the game, but I got a late start this afternoon.

  - 'Yes, it was a beautiful day. This is our second find and were still excited. We left the $ alone and signed the log. We were going to attempt the nearby confluence but decided to walk over and admire the Duke Chapel which is only a few blocks away. By the way, the centralized honor system parking meter is a joke. It ate our cents and never produced a ticket.'

  - 'Fun find on a nice day in NC! Clue was key to this find.'

Dont worry, plants werent damaged and we put everything back the way it was. Didnt sign the log for lack of pen, but took the feather and left Sacagawea. NC_WaterSpirit & The Duke Boys'

We found the area easily and with the hint we were able to find the cache with a little digging. It is there, but it was under a lot of brush. Some of the log pages are damp, but the last log put a new sliver of paper that is dry and in good shape. We signed the log and went off to the game in Chapel Hill. Duke won after having lost the last years. I guess it was their time and it was a good game. Thanks for reminding us of our college years and thanks for a good cache!'

  - 'Had to decrypt the hint for this one turns out I had looked in the right spot, but not hard enough! Was afraid maybe Isabelle had displaced the cache, but instead she just caused the log to be rather damp. Was able to find a small dry spot to sign, but suggest maybe replacing the log sheet at this point. Looks like its also getting mildewy. Thanks for the hunt! and Conan the geodog'

  - 'Found the cache today, right around lunch time. It rained here last night. Very humid outside, looks like it is going to rain tonight as well. Contents of cache intact and in good condition, although the log looks like it is about worn out from so many foldings and unfoldings.

We had previously questioned the GPS as we were unable to locate Bookcache after two different attempts. We forgot a pen or pencil to enter our find, but hope to return later in the week. The garden was extremely busy and with Easter being this weekend parking will be very limited. Great fun.'

I did leave a mini BadtzMaru eraser to prove my visit. Badtz'

  - 'Duke Gardens has to be one of the truly lovely places to visit in North Carolina! Have been here many times, as had most cachers who left notes. My faithful yellow Etrex couldnt seem to hone in as at other sites. Went around in circles for a while! Found the cache only after checking the cheat. The hiding spot certainly is unique good job! Hopefully the gardening staff will not find it by accident! Two sheets of notepaper in one tiny mm film container neat. It was so cold that only pansies were in bloom, but come anyway. Thanks from me and alpacafarmer, who was with me before heading back home to snowy West Va. tomorrow.'

There is still room on the papers for more logs. Thanks.'
  - 'Thanks for showing me this place. The gardens were worth the trip. Found cache and took photos a several travel bugs enjoying the area. Thanks for the hunt.'
  - 'Very nice... though Im a die hard Tarheel, I must admit that Duke Gardens makes the UNC botanical gardens look like East LA. The GPS got us within feet, but still on a different path... took us a while to locate the spot. Great hide, and Im so happy that Sarah won her battle!'
  - 'First find of the day and a great place to start the morning. Found the cache without too much trouble. Thanks for a cache in such a beautiful place!'
  - 'This was our second find of the day second find ever, for that matter . The asiatic garden was very pretty. We found several water pots We also saw a rabbit runnig away from us, so all we really saw was his tail and back feet when we came off of the zig zagging bridge. Wendy, Gordon'

  - 'Found this one very easily. We often come to the gardens but we had not found this spot before, kind of hidden away! Thanks.'
  - 'In a neat little nook Id overlooked in previous visits to the gardens. It would be a very relaxing place if it werent for the incessant hum coming from the hospital! Visited this one with , who found the goods. My Meridian got us within feet, even with all the tree cover at least after Id put the correct coords in a keying error had us in the native plants area a tenth of a mile away initially! .

Took a few moments to enjoy the cool spring air and lush vegetation. Nearby creek was relaxing too. took a little rubbery porcupine guy and a truck and we left a mini videogame and some Christmas mice. I put a new bag around the log since the big one has a hole right near the zipper.'
  - 'First cache for us! My wife, two daughters ages and and I went out for this one. We found it to be just right for a first cache. Its nice and secluded now that the foliage has filled in. Despite being relatively close to a trail and having a major town of Cary function going on in the park, we didnt have to worry about the public. We tried two ways to access the cache location. The first, which seems like it should be the main route, is starting to get choked off by briars. It was too grown over to get through without blood being drawn. We turned around and tried a second, which was a slightly discernable social trail. That route ended in success. D We took a small plastic snake and an eraser, and left a mechanical duck.'
  - 'Second of two today with the whole crew and Otterdude. Left snake, took mini videogame thing. Thank you!'

Our GPS gave us conflicting directions after we got within a hundred yards and we were a little careless. We did find it at last and discovered a wet paper booklet for kids among the cache. We didnt take it out though as we hand nothing to put back. I guess these things all need to be in plastic bags. Thanks for the hunt and the new hobby.'

  - 'Found with my father in law after finding CammoCan cache. My father in law had borrowed the GPSr a Garmin GPS my wife currently has on loan from a friend and was using it to navigate to the cache. He was using the screen that lists the closest caches and updates their relative location and direction in real time. What he didnt realize was that it also orders them by closest in real time too! So, all of a sudden he started saying, its this way and my GPSr was saying it was the other way! Needless to say, things got a bit confusing. Once we figured out, though, that this cache had moved up in the list we headed out in the right direction. The area was pretty well overgrown and it was getting dark but we managed to go for a bit and then reach a clearing so I could get a better satellite lock. After that, I had a pretty good bearing on the cache and headed around an obstacle. I went for a bit and then said, hmm... it should be getting close. I turned on my flashlight, shined it forward and voila! there was the cache. By this time it was getting fairly dark under the forest canopy so Im glad we found it when we did. Took a small frisbee and left a pinwheel. When I got back to the car and showed the frisbee to my wife she laughed because apparently it was the one she left in the cache when she found it several weeks ago! Oh well. Thanks for a good cache.'
  - 'very fun search, one of my first ever, this stuff is fun.'

  - 'Found with . Now I have an account of my own!'
  - 'Walked right by it at first guess my geocaching instincts are a little too firmly rooted, so to speak. Then I sat my toddler down on a log and found it on the second pass. We took a helicopter and a wooden knob, and left a toy my mind is going Ive forgotten what toy we left! and a lobster.'
  - 'This was the last of the caches we found on our first evening geocaching. A bit further off the path than I was expecting & we ended up walking past it twice before I started trusting the GPS enough to do what it told me! Good thing I had decrypted the additional hints before leaving home. Signed the logbook & my swapped a batman action figure for a pin that caught his eye. Thanks for the walk through a part of Bond Park wed never been to.'
  - 'My wife wanted to visit Spring Days at Bond Park this year, so I went with her... and while she was checking out the vendor booths, I went geocaching for the first time. The cache was a bit further off the beaten path than I was expecting, but I finally reached the general vicinity. My GPS was accurate to about feet, so I was pretty close. This being my first hunt, I didnt know what to expect. I first looked around to see if the cache was in plain site, but it didnt seem to be. Then I started looking in holes in the ground, etc. Still no luck. I was about to leave a bit disappointed when I noticed a debris pile that looked more man made than natural. I poked at it with a hoping I wasnt about to make some wild animal angry , and there it was! My first geocache find! It was fun to see what others had left there. I didnt bring anything to leave in it myself, so I didnt take anything either. I just signed the log and returned it to its hiding place. Thanks for the fun introduction to geocaching!'
  - 'This was my kids second cache they had fun. tn ln'
  - 'Its always great to find a venerable cache. This one was on the approval list, making it one of the oldest ones Ive yet found. I suspect it has brought many folks to the sport. The park where the cache is hidden was worth the visit and the cache remains loaded with excellent trade goods. TN, left a geoGeorge$ and signed the log.'

  - 'This was the last of the four caches we looked for and found while visiting Cary from Aiken, SC for the weekend soccer tournament. I was extremely surprised how easily we found this one without much of a map of the city, and no map of the park. The hint was indespensible though. This one was found by John. We didnt see any travel bugs which was unfortunate since we wanted to give one a lift south, but we did get an extremely close look at a Great Blue Heron which was sweet. Thanks for the adventure.'

So I left your cache there and went home and looked up this web site. It looked like fun, so I got a gps and now hunt geocaches. Thanks for the great introduction to Geocaching!'
  - 'The whole Geo Roaches crew went out searching today. Found this fairly quickly. Nice Cache. Thanks! Took clicker and Donald Duck head, left glue and post it notes.'
  - 'We made the same mistake another did. We were on the correct side of the creek, but our navigator me! thought the cache was on the other side. Once on the other side, we realized we were ok to begin with. Three of the kids with us managed to cross the creek both times on an old tree fallen across the creek, while those us more cautious sane? took the bridge. We left various items, including a Carolina Hurricanes window er go Canes! .'
  - 'Real nice walk in a park we have never visited before. We were on the right side of the creek and got mixed up and went around to the other, then found that we had to go back around. Thanks very much for a real nice part of our caching day.'
  - 'I saw this one before Dad did, I took a vegie tales keychain.'
  - 'We just stopped by for a walk in the woods and to help the travel bugs listed as being here on their way. The only one that was in the cache was Little Pieces. Both, Just Buggin and PFC Bug, Army of One, have gone AWOL. I will place Little pieces in a new cache in the next few days. Thanks for the time in the woods with my daughter. and'

  - 'Fourth of five for the day. Had my wife Eva and our dog satchet with me. I Spotted it first, but let Eva find it .'
  - 'My six year old, Addison, spotted this one today. We had passed it and had to double back. This is relatively near another cache also located at Bond Park. Probably a good dual for local cachers. Glad to see that you are using the reliable standard cache container, as all the items were nice and dry. Addison took a plastic bug as opposed to a travel bug and left a toy train car. We signed log. It was an excellent day to be out to walk off some of the Christmas turkey. Thanks for the find.'
  - 'Thought this might be the last cache of the day, but I was able to squeeze one more micro in afterwards. TNLN, but enjoyed the search!'
  - 'Found the Good , TN but left a new bug. I left PFC Bugg, Army of One. I wish for him to continue his journey.'
  - 'This was our first of three today. We walked along the path thinking we would get closer. We walked all the way around it until we came to the softball field. We began walking to the point and had to cross the small stream, not bad unless you have small kids. We found it fairly quick after that. Took the gold coin and toy dog. We left the batman and plastic bug. Thanks for the hunt. CITO'
  - 'Absolutely gorgeous day to be walking in the woods. I dropped my camera case by the lake, and five minutes later when I went back to look for it, it had disappeared. I saw no TB in the box.'
  - 'Must have just missed FinnInFla. Easy find nearby to another. Quick hike in and hike out. Signed log, TN LN.'

  - 'It was a nice morning, and I thought me and my dog needed a good cache... Well, what we really needed by the end was a good bath! The rain had really muddied up the surrounding area and trails, but it was a good find. One thing about a cache that has been around a while.. even the mistakes start forming paths. Found a path and thought this must be it... Me and the Geodog soon found ourselves on the wrong side of the creek a few hundred feet from the cache... Cache was found in good condition TNLN, signed log.'
  - 'In the Triad on business; decided to spend Sunday doing some caching Triangle style. Well, I spent the better part of the morning on my flights over here reading the endless articles about Tobey Maguire in that new Seabiscuit movie. Well just call ME Tobey Maguire...Spiderman! I walked face first through at least webs on the way to this one...blecch. In between fighting tree canopy and flailing my arms around to get the webs out of my mouth, somehow I walked right up to this one. The caching gods were smiling on me. Left Stealth TB, TNSL. Thanks! Dave R., Biloxi, MS'
  - 'Found the third and final cache of our day my birthday! . Good spot although we got a little nervous that we were on the wrong side of the creek! Had nothing left to leave, but took a polished rock.'
  - 'Second trip to this cache. Waah someone got the California Bear travelbug before us. TNLN.'
  - 'Wow! What a hike...we walked faster than the GPS could keep up...so we ended up walking past several times. We are a bit new at this Great spot. Left pink white car took caterpillar.'
  - 'This was our find of today and our in Bond Park. The description read Due to the visible nature . . Do not expect this cache to be visible. It is a good ways in the woods and does require bushwacking. There were no travel bugs in the cache. The cache was in good condition but needs refreshing. Thanks for the hunt. This is a beautiful park with lots of possibilities.'
  - 'Hello This was the first of Two caches today. I had planned on picking up the two travel bugs that are listed as being here, but they were gone. I guess I should have read the other logs, as the last person reported this also. I used to work at the ropes course here at Bond park and it was nice to be out there again. The Geo Hounds loved the creek, and enjoyed many swims. The tree cover is so heavy out there that the GPS seemed as it could not be trusted. Little did I know that I was standing just feet away from it at one point before I went back to the trail to get a new reading and then head back in. One thing that I tried that may work for others is that I used my old reliable magnetic compass to help find the way. I would tell the GPS to go to a different waypoint when it seemed confused, and then once it had a reading on that one, I would switch back to s cache. Then, I could get a compass heading to follow on the GPS, and go in that direction with the magnetic compass. Thanks for the fun, and his Geo hounds Samba and Ripple the Choc and Yellow Labs'
  - 'I was in Bond Park with my Daughter to do the Orienteering Class that is given second Sat of every month. No GPS just a compass But I bought along the GPS so that afterwards my daughter and I could look for this cache. This is our first find! We took the shells and left behind a Caterpillar from a Taco Bell Bug Kids Meal. Cache is in excellent shape.'
  - 'Found the cache while exploring Raleigh area parks on a beautiful June day. GPS acting up as usual under heavy tree cover and took a bit a searching to find this one. Note that cache is several hundred feet off the trail and some non trivial bushwacking is required. May not be one for small children. Picked up MARINE CORPS SPECIAL FORCES. Didnt see JUST BUGGIN or CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR BEAR but may have missed them as we were only expecting to find one TB in this cache.'
  - 'This was our second find. We are so new at this that we didnt know we could click nearby cashes. I found out today at work that there were more within feet of this one.... wonder we hadnt stumpled onto them! We took a pencil, pen, toy car, book mark, the round tuit, and the measuring tape. Left a Nemo fish, blue glass rocks, book mark, the Marine Corps Special Fources travel bug, and a pocket size pack of tissues. The log book bag was torn down the side. Well probably go back this weekend for the other cashes and leave a new bag if needed. Thanks.'
  - 'Nice walk in a park we didnt know existed. Nice container and paintjob. Left some stuff and took a pen. Thanks'

  - 'Related Web Page I found it after getting really lost. Originally I mistyped the coordinates and ended up on the corner of Chatham St. and Cary Parkway, but I knew I was near Helixblues place so I called him and got a ride back to my car at Bond Lake to start over with corrected coords. I found a neat, asleep little fuzzy bat hanging upside down near the cache too. See website for more photos.'

Amelia did all the work on this one, and took a little doll. Along with our travel bug, we left a Canadian tooney, from the stash of coins left from our recent trip to British Columbia where Whistler is eventually headed .

Here is the one thing you need to know to find it, it is the trail beside the pipe coming from the lake. At the bench it is located across from it. It is a trail and after the ice storm be prepared to climb over down branches and newly growing thorns. I did find a travel bug and plan to move it on. I left a tape mesure and some bullet shells my friend and i found with his metal detector AT BOND PARK. Feel free to email me but no spam. I handed the travelbug on to my teacher who is involved in geocaching. he is moving the bug onto a spot in fort bragg.'

Left a travel bug from the Triangle meeting, took trash. Thanks! Theres a discernable path from the bench on the trail straight toward the cache clearly, G.G. has succeeded in drawing many visitors!

  - 'Found it. The cache is dry and in great shape. I really enjoyed the walk to this one. I ran into a young family on their first day of caching. Its always great to see kids enjoying outside activities with their parents. I used to hang out at this lake in the old days late Back then it was called Bass Lake but all the partiers called it A Lake because of all the skinny dippers. We were thrown out by the Wake Co. deputies every week, but always came back. They could have put up a chain to keep us out, but I think the law enjoyed the view too much to make us quit. Good memories. I left some dog toys and took the deck of cards.'
  - 'Had some trouble with this one our first day and getting tired . Took a paddle boat break in between caches. A lot more bush for this one than I expected and still getting acquainted with my GPSr. Happened upon another cacher that was conveniently coming away from it, so we got some helpful tips. It was practically under our noses. My son couldnt make up his mind, but eventually took the dollar and left a stuffed McBunny.'
  - 'Good ! Did alittle bushwhacking but not too much. All in the game. Fun cache! Took the Pepsi ball key chain and left a cool Railinc coaster. I want a T shirt! The .'

  - 'Teaching my nephew the ins and outs of the GPS so I decided to hit this one again since its pretty easy. I also wanted to drop off Steggy the travel bug since Id had him a while and I just wasnt sure I could get him to a cache hed like any time soon. Drove him around in my car for a few days so hed think he was far from home ; .'
  - 'Somewhat easy spot. I would hate to have to use the toilet paper. Mosquitos were plentiful. I saw no snakes. There was a squirrel eating in the tree above me as I plundered the stash so I kept getting pelted with nut casings. Then I saw another couple of squirrels tearing trough the brush and chirping at one another. I would have like to stay longer but I had donated enough blood to the mosquitos and wanted to bug out. My fault for going in the evening with no DEET. I left my TRAVEL BUG Smiling Ichiro He will start his journey here.'
  - 'Along with newbie cacher Unca Bob and his faithful hound Daisy, we found this cache with no problem. Clever hiding place. Where Im from in Texas we would use a pile of limestone rocks to achieve the same effect. Took chocolate color rubber stamp pad, left a color plastic easter egg from the Cache as Cats Can cache nearby. Last cache in North Carolina for now, enjoyed your state and several of your geocaches, now back home to Texas to cool off and nurse these deep mortal flesh wounds you would call Mosquito Bites. You North Carolinians have got mosquitos that put Texas most vicious insect pests to shame. Come visit Texas and just laugh at our evil fire ants, theyre nothing compared to the winged bloodthirsty vampires infesting your woods.'
  - 'Thanks for a great cache. This was my first geocache find. It was a great location, easy spot for a beginner. Hot and humid, but thats NC in the summer.'
  - 'Found this cache after a relatively short search around the area. WARNING! There was a copperhead snake resting just inches away from the cache today. Fortunately my father in law spotted just as I was about to pick the cache up. It slithered out of view without further incident, but I was a little shook up. I dont know if copperheads tend to hang around the same place long, but I would reccommend keeping your eyes open for this one.'

  - 'What fun! My first cache find and what a blast it was. I never knew the park was that big. Hiking in the woods made me realize more just how dry this summer has been no water in the creek. It rained as I was starting my search and that made it just interesting enough but I found myself repeating I cant wait till Fall. hot, humid, y, ticks, briars, and baseball pinging. The cache was well hidden and a challenge to find but not too too difficult. I took a key chain and left a deck of cards.'
  - 'Found it on or about without incident, other than the mosquitos. Thanks.'
  - 'This was our first Geocaching trip and our first find! We brought our dog, Matt, and really enjoyed the hike. Lost our signal, three times in the dense part of the woods, but we made it to the cache. Took a slinky I love slinkys! and left a ladybug beanie!'

  - 'Hurrah! This was my first Geocache find out of three attempts. Nice hiding job, fellas I found it after Id been searching around the fallen trees for almost twenty minutes. I decided to take a break and sit down on one of the logs when I caught it out of the corner of my eye. Moooooooo!'
  - 'Walk right to within before things fell apart. I even walked along the top of the downed tree but didnt see it. It took me a good min. to find it, I dont know what my problem was. As I was writing in the journal someone else came along and I was forced to either hide and make it as hard for them as it was for me, or stand up and say hello and give it away. Well, Im pretty friendly so... I stood up. I am real familiar with the area as I work at the High Ropes course at Bond Park. No excuse for it taking so long. I did have a lot of fun though. Dogman'

  - 'Beautiful day for a stroll through the park. Libby loved the doggy beach. The ducks were a little rattled though. Great cache! Our eTrex played a few games with us but Kara prevailed. The toilet paper was a great idea, but we opened the cache about minutes too late for it to be of any use ; Walking through the creek bed we were able to get within or feet of a large grayish brown hawk about a wingspan sitting on a branch above and keeping an eye on us as we passed by below. Its probably a good thing we had just dropped Chester the littlest mongrel off at home. We took cents in African coins and a deck of cards. We left behind a Magic card and an Iguana. How do we hook this guy up with a travel bug anyway? Thanks for the fun, Kara, Tom & Paul plus just Libby this time'

Our youth pastor took the car lamp that was in the cache and we left a of AA batteries for someone elses GPS.

Thanks for a fun hunt!'

The goal was to create a report to be aired tonight, on the oclock news. This geocache, in Bond Park, was the best target I could think of. It is interesting in that it is hidden in the woods, yet is in a populated area. Also, I was pretty sure I could find it again. Watch the WB news and see if we did a good job of representing geocaching and how much fun it is. I took a keychain flashlight and left a flower pot.'
  - 'This is the first cache I have ever found. I heard about this sport only last week while playing with my new Etrex Vista. It was a great find!

  - 'I went to this cache several days ago, so My write up is from a weak memory. After reading many of the log entries about not wanting to be on the wrong side of the creek... I wound up on the wrong side of the creek. I was able to find a downed tree across the creek and make a successful crossing without getting wet. This was a pretty easy cache to find, and it is extremely full. I removed the Sherlock Holmes diskette, and a kids meal toy it took up way too much room , in there place I left pairs of kids sunglasses. The cache was in very good shape and the area is nice and clean. I talked with the cache owner and got permission to remove the red towel that was left as a marker. I think it looks kind of trashy. Hopefully I will be able to return soon to get it out of there. If someone else visits this cache before I can return please remove the towel. All in all, it was a great cache even though I got drenched on the way out rain not the creek . Since I was already wet I decided to check out the Mulch Education area that I parked near. Pretty nifty stuff if your into dirt. Thanks again for another fun find . Great Hunting... Great Caching. Gabchoud'
  - 'This was my first cache find also. I went with my two kids and a friend and his son. We had a little problem with the creek, didnt know which side of the creek the cache was hidden.

We took some gold coins, a golf ball, finger skateboard and a keychain. Thanks'
  - 'Found this cache this evening our first in North Carolina after returning from a vacation in Pennsylvania where we got hooked on Geocaching ! It was a quick find. The jar was hidden off the trail in the woods behind a very large tree that had fallen over maybe from Hurricane Fran? Next to it was a dark red t shirt. Didnt decode the hint, but noticed on the web site that the bear jar was supposed to be in a hollow tree..? We enjoyed the hunt just the same! We saw an owl during our early evening hunt. It was awesome! The cache is jam packed with stuff. We took Woody and the Cheerios car, and left a Pennsylvania key ring. Thanks for taking the time to hide this cache. Its great to have one so close!'
  - 'My first cache! I read about this in the Raleigh N&O and was intrigued, bought a GPS through eBay for $ and now Im hooked! Since I live only a mile from Bond Park and Im a longtime orienteerer I thought this would be easy Oh no! Finally found the bear on my visit. SPOILER INFO FOLLOWS Someone has left a bright red towel at the tree to help. The downed tree is easier to see if you approach from the stream instead of the trail. P.S. You need a bigger bear! Im afraid the scrunched glider will never fly. Thanx again!'
  - 'I found this one Sunday afternoon Real nice park. I lived in Cary for years and passed this park at least a hundred times and never gave it a second thought as to checking it out. I will certainly be back. Left a scateboard I got at the Falls Lake cache and also left a dodge viper RT.'
  - 'Our first find! Had been out on July with my wife, and we couldnt find it...this time, we had a better idea where to look. My nine year old took the Pokemon cards, and we left some toys. A nice walk.'
  - 'My first geocache find! Heavy canopy cover prevented my GPS from getting good signals, but we did eventually find it. I crossed creek twice looking. We took work gloves and left a foil pack of Pokemon Fossil, edition playing collector cards. It had rained earlier and the foliage got me soaking wet! Great site and my yo son thought that the outing was cool!'
  - 'Found this one after trying to approach from the wrong side of the stream . Good hiding spot in a popular park in Cary. Almost didnt see it was dark and the blue top made it blend in with surroundings. Took the fireworks and left leather work gloves the slinky wouldnt fit through the jar .'

I have never been there before so I enjoyed it more. I removed nothing, but I left my traditional mini wooden chess set for those who may follow.'
  - 'Excellent hiding spot, I circled right by it on my first attempt about two weeks ago and I was looking right at it for about five minutes before I realized Id found it today. I think I may have shoved the bear even farther up in the tree than it was before... so look deep.'
  - 'We found your cache today. This was our first one. With all the leaves it was hard to get an accurate GPS signal. One minute we were feet away, then we were feet. There are a number of locations in the immediate area. We found a few possible locations for the cache. One, however, had a very, very, very large ugly spider in it.

  - 'Found this cache. Took a little whacking in, but took the easier way out. Needs some work, no real contents and log book is soaked. Signed best we could. Thanks a bunch!'
  - 'Just logging this so the site will know we found it.'
  - 'Had to go into authorized personnel only property to get this one, but tried not to touch anything. The log book is very wet. I think this has been muggled because neither of the travel bugs were there. one of today for us. Left happy snappy travel bug and took cents. TFTH!'
  - 'Easy find, however the access to cache is hampered by constructions nearby. Cache needs maintenance logbook is wet so I made no entry. I grabbed the geocoin to take it on a long journey... thanks for cache and regards from Germany'
  - 'is now .'
  - 'Third find! We took the scenic route, but got no scrapes or scratches. Thanks to for closer coordinates. Took a Green Jeep TB. Left a Geocoin. If we had not found this one, we would have been in hot water with momma.'
  - 'GPS was creating a lot of problems for us on this one somehow we still managed to find the right area. TFTH'
  - 'This was of for me after work today. I grabbed the Green Jeep TB and left the Legoman TB. TFTC!'
  - 'Found this cache on a rainy day. Was out to get a Green Jeep and knew it wouldnt stay there long. Nice hide. I ended up trading Green Jeeps. Now there is one there for the next cacher. SL TFTH!'
  - 'Splitting off from to form my own account. Logging all of my past finds with this generic note.'
  - 'Well, we took the shortest route from the nearest parking and had some tough bushwhacking and plenty of thorns to deal with at first. We then discovered that was all unnecessary as we could have parked near the Just Dessert cache and had a slightly longer, but much easier walk into this one. We used the coordinates the previous cacher posted and they led us right to the cache. The GPSr showed at the cache. The original coordinates showed away on our GPSr. We didnt see any TBs in the cache. I notified the TB owners. We did leave a Green Jeep though, so now there is one in there. Took nothing, left Green Jeep TB. TFTC!'
  - 'When the author warns about thorns, take it to heart. I had jeans on and still got sliced up. I recomend a heavy long sleave shirt or jacket, too. Only about yards is really bad, then it opens upe to an easy walk. This will become a park and grab when the new section opens up, but until then... I also found this off the coords. I did about a min average and found it to be at N W The cache is empty. I placed your log in a plastic bag to save what I could and left you a new log in another plastic bag. TFTH!'
  - 'Finally after three times and a hint from another cacher we found this one. My year old stumbled on walking out I was a good ft west of the coordinates. TFTH. Needs maintenance as it is depleted and the log book is wet. I live a mile away and will try to add some stuff next week.'
  - 'Found this one today with and girls. Met while looking for the cache. Talked with them for awhile witch was nice to do since we are newbies. Cache is in great location but is in need of maintenance. Picked up Gecko Club travel bug will move on. Thanks for the hide.'
  - 'Found this today and met some other new cachers! How fun! The cache was a little depleted and the log book was wet. I would have left another log book but I didnt have a plastic bag with me to keep it dry. Cool location though. Great hunt! Thanks! We did drop off our new travelbug though...actually gave it to the cachers we met at the cache so they could pass it on!'
  - 'Found it with my family today. The log was a little soggy, maybe from the recent rains. TNLN. Thanks for the find.'
  - 'Nice park. Thanks for the hide. Found with Geochicken this am.'
  - 'Found this one while caching with this morning. TFTH!'
  - 'Wow it took a couple of tries and some crawling around. We found it on the way out a couple of cool tags also. The cache is back in its original spot, circle of trees. It will be much easier to find now that its home. Enjoy!'
  - 'We went too late in the day and the overgrowth made it very difficult to see. Lots of heavy brush, very much suggest wearing jeans and boots. We are going to try again today wish us luck!'
  - 'I think I went out to late on this one. Near dusk and it was hard to see even with my light. Between the overgrowth and the thorns it was a bit tough. Ill try back in the daytime.'
  - 'Whew, wear your hiking boots and be ready to bushwhack! This ones a little off the beaten path. Almost gave up, but Im glad I didnt. Took Turkey TB and Lancia TB, left The Bead Bug TB. is now'

  - 'A nice little hike into this one while skirting the construction site. One of the few regulars we found while down. TN L TBs SL.'
  - 'Once we got around the construction, wasnt too bad to find. TFTC !'
  - 'Walked around in circles slowly narrowing in on this one....almost gave up. Glad we did not. Eventually were able to get close enough to find this cache. Some heavy bushwacking at times here. Bad idea after any amount of rain. SL & left a Ty bear. TFTC'
  - 'TFTH'
  - 'Tfth lots of bushwacking needed to get to it....dont wear short sleeves this time of year. fun one though'
  - 'Not sure why this one took so long for me to find. My GPSr had me looking about from where the caches was. After searching for awhile, I put the GPSr away and searched the good old fashion way and found the cache shortly after. Everything is in good shape. Dropped of Best Looking Cache TB, SL and followed the construction path back to my car. This is going to be one BIG baseball park when it is finished!'
  - 'Very little bushwacking was needed to get to this one. The construction in the area just provides a minor obstacle that can easily be avoided. The Little Cachette took something and left something but not sure what! Thanks for the cache.'
  - 'Caching with Team Eminwf today, and very much enjoying this park. Construction has ruined the approach to this cache, but with some relocation, a good thing can be continued. Kids thrilled with yet more happy meal type toys. Mom thrilled with drink machines that take credit cards. TFTC!'
  - 'The cache is still there and chock full of happy meal toys. The kids were very excited to do this cache re happy meal toys but it is not appropriate for young or whiney children now. The construction has blocked off the paved path and the moderate walk has changed to a ft bushwack through thick underbrush. Considering I had to use some cattails as stepping stones this cache will probably be very difficult to get to if it ever rains. T Happy meal toys and ticks shudder L Happy meal toys'

  - 'time is the charm, apparently... or maybe it was the fact that i didnt bring my two year old. Shes not a fan of the thick woods you have to go through to get to this one. I saw a cool flower on the way in. Ill post a picture and maybe someone can tell me what it is. While i was signing the log, i heard a snort and looked up to see a deer about feet off, running away. I must have missed it and it me on the way in. Took a little fairy with flappy wings and left a MicroPet that looks kind of like a panda.'
  - 'Came out here after playing in the sand and the big tunnel slide with little She was agreeable enough at first find a toy... in a hole... i get to pick... find something... but about the time we got right on top of it according to the GPS she had had enough go home, my house .

My son was delighted by all of the toys in the cache, and finally chose a King Mickey Mouse windup toy. I grabbed a tiny green mug. We left Snow white and a little green flute. Caught a tick walking across my lap, so we made tracks back to the car. CITO!'

The actual cache area is very nice, with many small pines. Amelia found the cache itself. We came for Kalis Key to My Heart travel bug, which we were happy to find. We meant to bring a Happy Meal toy, but left it in the car, so instead we left $ in Canadian coins a loonie and four Canadian quarters. Also left an Alethiometrists bag tag. Thanks for the cache!'
  - 'Related Web Page I came to this cache a few weeks ago after work, and was surprised by the thick brush. I was wandering for about minutes in my nice dress clothing for work, getting some minor holes in my slacks. During which, I struck myself in the eye. I searched on for another minutes with one hand over my eye, and then conceded defeat. I was embarrassed, knowing that several people used this cache as their very first geocache and found it without issue. My eye was in pain for the rest of the evening. So, I came back friday from work. This time, I was wearing jeans, and had no plans to poke my eye out. I told myself Not only am I going to do this, but Im going to do it without a GPS, since I knew I was in the right area. I set a timer, and jogged from my car, to the cache, finding the cache within minutes, logging myself, and jogging back. Elapsed time Revenge. Thanks for the fun!'

I left a Star Wars Let the force decide top. Its like a magic ball but you spin it and the answer lights up and it plays music. Thanks. Chris'
  - 'Related Web Page What a great day for a walk! Were learning that part of the trick to navigating by GPS is to guess where the path turns ahead of you and when its time to go bushwacking through the woods. Found this one without too many problem. Took Lion King figurine, left dog figurine. Thats a very cool Stitch bobble head in there, too, but I didnt have anything with me to swap for that one...'
  - 'Great spot. I had too make it a little more difficult so I hiked through the briars. Took the path on the way out though! TN LN'
  - 'Yea, its spring again. I love to cache on the motorcycle, you already have long pants and boots on. Driving on some semi country back roads in weather is great. When I turned into the park I thought I was back at the Ball & Chain cache. Some of these Cary parks look the same, very nice. I found the cache in good shape but it did take a little while, there are thousands of mounds of pine straw everywhere with no knowing if the cache was even in any of them. I left the happy couple and took the TB and the doodle art set for Boys and their toys.'
  - 'Coordinates right on again. Nice sports complex. Cary does seem to have the neatest parks around. We took a Samuri Jack toy and left Doodle pen top. We also dropped off Sammy the Sailfish TB he wants to head to salt water. Thanx for the hunt! Jeff, Traci, Wes and Sid The Davis Family'
  - 'I found this cache this afternoon. This was both my first cache and my fathers first cache. My father is from Torrington, CT and I am right down the street in Cary Park.

This is one of the best stocked caches I have ever seen; the drive in must love you guys. Left a Hot Wheels Geo Blaster still in its wrapper and took a Chipmunks Cable Car. I think it will become my next travel bug.'
  - 'Very well hidden. I searched for over an hour for this one. The pines make the GPS go a little crazy, but it looks like the coordinates were close once I got a good siginal. Left a wheres george, and took a little toy. OH YEAH, ANOTHER FTF . Theres another way in that doesnt require you to go through the park, but the park is nice.'

  - 'Took cuttermike with me. He spotted it first. It was cool to watch someone find their first cache. TNLNSL'
  - 'Nice walk. Only a couple of dogs in the park. Sure miss my dogs, visiting from Oregon. No problem finding the cache. Thanks Whisper'
  - 'Setting up the kids account and backlogging their finds.'
  - 'Picked kiddies up from school and had time to do this one before dark. Walked along ridge at top of dog park coming back and found a benchmark for anyone interested. Thanx for the wonderful hide.'

  - 'Great cache. What a wonderful setting. Take the dog!'
  - 'Nice St. Patricks Day find. Thanks for the hide!'
  - 'found with after work. was a nice walk in a beautiful setting.'
  - 'Found this one after work with Frog We walked across dam and straight to the cache. Cache not too heavily hidden. Hope it last till grass grows in area. Thanks for bringing me to this beautiful area. TNLNSL'
  - 'I tried this one before but didnt check long since a guy was hanging around the area and asking me questions. Today I tried it again with Helixblue and our dog, and we found it pretty quickly. We left a Stress Ball.'
  - 'found Now...this was a real adventure!Started by walking across the field, but the water was rushing too fast to go that way, and the gate was locked going up. So..I went back out to the road and cheated around the stream. Finally found my way to the cache. Going out,I found an open gate, walked across the top to another gate, then down a very steep hill to the truck. But, all in all, it was worth it. Took a carabiner, left army guys and one of my cards. thanx. Doc'
  - 'I parked in the little lot and walked across the field. I saw no large land mines. I got to the spillway area and a lot of water going through it. I really got wet feet. Got to the cache area and spent about five min. looking for it. I took the travel bug and the runing around the block gag prize. I left a Wooden Nickel and some play doo. I walked back across the dam. Thanks for a enjoyable cache. CC'
  - 'Interesting area. T cat, L army guy. Thanks for the cache!'
  - 'I tried to find this geocache yesterday during my lunch hour, but after a little while of looking around, a guy came by and started questioning me about what I was doing and the travelbugs I was carrying. He seemed to be following me around and was making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to just go back another time when I have someone else with me.'
  - 'We went out one evening last week to try to find this cache, but there were so many people and dogs.. big wet dogs! out there. It got dark pretty quickly, so we gave up to go back this evening. We found it within a minute through luck! Good hide! Left a fitness block. TN.'
  - 'It wasnt THAT bad of a hike up there. I think its just intimidating walking through the DOG park WITHOUT a dog. That was harder than the hill. Everyone looks at you wondering what you are up to. Found it. Traded travel bugs and took a yoyo, left a key chain & stickers.'
  - 'I found this cash with my crew of four cache hunters and we had a ball. I have lived in and around Bloomington most of my life. I have driven by Griffy Lake before but in good busybody style I have never stopped to smell the roses. I think that is one of the things I like most about this sport. I love the woods but sometimes you need a good reason to get out there and geocaching gives you that reason. Sorry didnt mean to wax philosopical. This was a great location for a cache. We arrived with no trouble and my four hunters went to work. We checked every hollow tree in the area because all our caches to this point were in hollow places. It did take us a good minutes to locate. This is a great hiding place. I took a few pictures that I will post. We picked up swallowtail TB and left The Sporting Life Bowling across America TB.'
  - 'THIS IS A CACHA WITH VIEW THANKS TNLC'
  - 'Got to agree. It is a nice view and a nice little hike. I am proud of myself. I didnt fall in the water once. Left Migratory Swallowtail TB. Thanks for the fun.'
  - 'Neat little cache and I really enjoyed the view. TN left a YoYo. Thank You.'
  - 'FTF Took first finders prize, left an antenna Icom pig. Cache is in good shape and rehid properly. No dogs this early Friday morning. Thanks for this cache and the nice first finders prize..'

  - 'Looked and looked and looked. Judging by the list of not founds, Im guessing its gone. Bummer.'
  - 'Tried today as it was so warm, I couldnt resist going caching. Tried looking for about minutes and then decided to give up since it hadnt been found in awhile. Could the owner check to see if its still there? Maybe it was muggled.'
  - 'Couldnt find this one today. It was a pretty day with lots of muggles in the park, so we didnt look too long.'
  - 'Shortly before I pulled up to the park, a van parked and guys got out and ate lunch at the park. I thought maybe they were geocachers. But I think this made me a little less diligent in my search.'

  - 'My cachin experience... Just had came back from taking my neice FireMamma to the hospital to get medicine for the posion ivy she had gotten while caching in McCormicks Creek, We were sitting at CVS waiting on the prescriptions to be filled and decided we had time to see if there was a cache near by. Fired up the GPSr and seen that there was a cache not more than a mile from where we were. With the year old FireFly fast asleep and the year old Fireflys Brother yelling Were going caching, were going caching we headed off to get this one. Got there and started up the trail and realized we had no flashlights! It was about So we tried to use our cell phones to see and that wasnt working well. Then we had a bright idea! Use the Laptop screen. Off went FireMamma to get the laptop, brung it back and the search began.. It is extremly hard to look through stuff while holding a sleeping child. FireMamma spotted it and Fireflys brother decided he needed the dinosaur that was in there. Unfortunately we didnt have anything to leave. Thanks for the great night of fun! and Gang!'

  - 'boo for failure. parked at the truck graveyard then headed in on the trailhead there, took a right and followed what seemed to be a dry creek before doing the uphill bushwhack but no luck. any hints would be appreciated. if anyones planning on doing this one id love to tag along and try again...'
  - 'THANKS FOR THE HUNT L SIG CARD'
  - 'Very nice hike in griffey. Had to hunt around to find this one.'
  - 'Not sure if its the one, accidentally found a cache near these cords, but its in a plastic container and not a coffee can as described, thought it might be another one, what the odds! Heres the pis of the cache, its all wet therefore we didnt take anything or sign the log book. Still, its a good hike, thanks!'
  - 'Went the on the wrong trail and climbed a lot of unnecessary ridges, but this led us to a dried river bed where we found a lot of geode rocks. This was my second cache and my buddies first, we booth had a great time. Hike was great, it does feel very remote once you are out there. Contents are still all wet. Still including the two old logbooks. The new temporary log book was fine and dry. Took the Images of Hawaii CD and left a small NASCAR tin.'
  - 'We finally found it! We took the path from the east from the truck graveyard. It was shorter but steeper! There were two old log books frozen, ruined, so we left a little temporary one until a new one can be put in. Everything was wet and icy. Took nothing.'
  - 'Nice hike .... cache was really waterlogged so we couldnt sign the log book.'
  - 'THIS IS A GRATE WALK IN I LOVE IT THANKS TNLC'
  - 'Whew! After an inadvertent bushwhack, I finally found it! Leaves poor signal. I removed a nasty ziplock bag and aired out the other one so that all of the doodads could go inside of it. The original logbook is still soaked and mouldy and sealed in a separate ziplock bag. Took a bouncy ball Left two vintage postcards of Bloomington in their own ziplock baggie'
  - 'After finding it I remembered....I forgot to mark the location of the car. Two hours later I am at the IU Golf Course! The funny thing is my husband and I left a golf ball, tee, and ball marker in the box! So, bring your clubs and hit the back end of the course! Saw two deer, two snake, and a chipmunk ran under my husbands arm! Thanks for the trip! It was our first! Nice location! I need to lose weight!'
  - 'Had a nice trip through the woods looking for this one. Spent about minutes stomping around all sides of the sinkhole and ridge with no luck.. Hope it wasnt down at the bottom of the sinkhole, because it was filled about waist deep with water. Did get startled by what I can only assume was a coyote. He was much bigger than any dog Ive seen. Very nice tan and white coat. Tried to get a picture but he disappeared too quickly. Also scared some college kids who figured they should follow natures lead and try to mate in the woods next to the creek. They ran off quicker than the coyote! Will try again next week or the week after that. Was the best trip out at Griffey despite not finding the cache!'
  - 'Found this cache with Jbyer and Erin. We hiked up hills, followed the needle straight as the crow flies for some of it. Good cache, we transported the Zenith bug to a different cache'
  - 'Had a good time traipsing through the woods with and to find this one. What a location! Its beautiful back there, albeit navigating the ridges when we discovered wed have to do some pretty exenstive pole vaulting to get to the other side got tiring. ; T TB, L plastic snake, SL.'
  - 'Found this cache, along with and . Beautiful park, will definitely come back and visit again. Logbook is still soaked, so used the one that left. Took the Zenith way travel bug, left a scary rubber snake.'
  - 'Not being from this area I totally relied on the GPS on this one. Looked like an approach from the east would be the best. Drove down what seemed like a long driveway, got to the end, and found what looked like a graveyard of old trucks.. There was the sign for the park hidden in the corner. Just then, the attack guard dog made his presence known, and tried biting my tires... Not a good start.. I decided to try approaching from the west. Drove all the way around, then found the Actual park. A little longer walk, but without dogs.. a good thing. Trails were muddy today, but at least the river seemed low as to make an easy crossing. When I got to the cache location I spotted it right away.. it was about feet away from any obvious hiding spot, laying right in the open. It seemed to be intact however. I rehid it in the most logical spot in that area I hope its the right spot! The log book was SOAKED! so I left a new, dry logbook, and the Zenith way Travel Bug I got in New Mexico. Took a star, and a matchbox car. The owner of this cache should check on it soon, and retrieve the soggy log book. Also, make sure I rehid it in the right spot Thanks for the cache, it was a great day!'
  - 'Found this one taking the long way also. Was a great day for it. Thanks TNLN'
  - 'My wife and I found it on our second try. The first try was yesterday this was not especially easy to find. We were motivated to find it today because it was placed two years ago this day. This is our first cache! We took nothing, left a rubber ball. Thanks!'
  - 'We followed the needle straight through the woods up steep hills and down ravines....beautifull Fall weather...good aerobic workout. Cache in tupperware is damp and molding so we took nothing and left nothing. We have found in MN that the qt. thermos containers work really well to keep out all kinds of weather. With the risk of sounding like alarmists, we found scat near the cache that is identical to Northwoods black bear droppings. Any comments? Bullthistle and Tansy'
  - 'Nice hike. I think I must have gone the long way around, but the trail was real nice and quiet. Came up on a couple of deer. The container had some water in it. I dumped it out and closed it securely. Took and left nothing, but signed the log.'
  - 'Should have read the past history, then we would have taken the side path and not the main path. Didnt want to get more chiggers than necessary, so well go back again another day and go the correct way. First time weve followed the creek path that far. This is our favorite place to get a quick hike in so close to home. Kids got tired and hungry, so we said wed go back another day and find it.'
  - 'Went to the coordinates and found a Large Tupper Ware Container not a Folgers Can, some contents were wet so I dried them best as I could. log was writeable so signed it and left the Beast and took Bugs Bunny Thanks for the hunt'
  - 'Nice hike. Musta took the wrong trail though because I ended up traipsing through the woods for a bit. Took some chapstick and left a hand warmer.'
  - 'This was our first Geocache. Took the trail along the creek, then turned up the hill and walked straight to it. Great hike, lots of fun! I think Im going to like this sport!'
  - 'This was my third attempt to find this cache. The first time I did not find the park. The second time I did not find the correct trail, and it was too late to backtrack. This time I picked the right trail. I got to within . miles and started to bushwhack. What a hike. Really made my heart pound, scaling that steep terrain. I found the cache with no problems. It was dry and in good condition. I followed the top of the ridge back and it made for easier going. Thanks for hiding this cache.'
  - 'Zoiks! I mustve taken the wrong trail. Ended up having to Bushwhack for at least mi UP a ridge to get there. When I got to the coords, I was convinced I had written them down wrong since I couldnt find any evidence of a trail within of the place. I was planning on calling it a screw up on my part cause I was looking at my notes that said relatively easy and pleasant hike... and figured Jeepers! I cant imagine a mi bushwack up as relatively easy BUT I figured since I was in the hood, may as well give it a few minutes before giving up. Glad I did since I found it . Tried to locate a trail back but gave up and followed a circuitous deer path along the ridge back to the creek deer droppings make for great trail markers! Took spidey Left Mardi Gras Beads A delightful hike!. Im definitely coming back here to see what other trails this great area has to offer. TONS of geodes in the creek, if youre into that sort of thing. Fun Cache, thanks!'
  - 'This was my find! Horray! We had been in this area a few times before but didnt have enough daylight to do this one. We like keeping the longer more scenic caches for day time to do them justice and Im sure glad we did. This area was beautiful. We took the rigdetop route on the way in and had to back track a little. We were so busy enjoying the sites we missed our turn to start bushwacking. Down the hill, across the creek and back up the other side. As we approached the cache I was thinking this was a sink hole from a cave. After walking around a little more and investigating, we determined that it was probably an old damn for a small pond. We found the cache without any problems. TN but I dont remember what I left. On the way out we took the creek route. Shortly after leaving the cache Remi jumped up some deer. Just so happened they ran in the direction we were headed. We later spotted them again on the opposite hill side. We counted six but there may have been one more. We watched them for a while and they watched us making sure they kept thier distance. Onward to the creek we went and a turkey ran across the trail right in front of us. They are like a Boeing taking off in flight but they run into stuff like they are crash landing. Going up or going down....not sure if they even know. Continued on to the lake to see hundreds of geese. Honk Honk is there some kind of traffic jam or what? All in all this was a great cache. We hiked miles, seen deer, a turkey, geese and some ice fisherman. I cant think of a better way to celabrate my find. Thanks for making it so memorable'
  - 'We also started out on the wrong trail and probably did a lot of hiking that wasnt necessary, but I wouldnt consider it wasted time at this cache. It is a really pretty area. We went up the hill right by the parking area and walked the top all the out and around, I glanced at the GPS and realized we were going farther away from it so we backtracked a little then went bushwacking. Down through the creek bottoms, across the creek, and up the other side, we found it with no problem. The cache was dry inside, but as previously mentioned there isnt much in it, TN and left glow in the dark stars, nail files, a tube of chapstick and a Hawaii screen saver CD. Checked out the neat views and took a few pics then started back toward the truck. Remi got on a scent trail and jumped a deer, when we walked through where she had jumped her there were a bunch of beds, and since they were going the direction we needed to go we pretty much followed their trail. Got to see them again across the next valley, there were at least We watched them for a while and I tried to get a pic but they were too far away. Finally got to the trail that follows the creek and had a turkey run across in front of us, then take off in flight, crashing through the trees. They fly like I Geocache. Stopped to get a pic of the rock formation with icicles hanging down. Knew we were close to the truck now because we could hear the geese honking! miles of hiking, deer, and a turkey later our adventure was over! Thanks for a great hike!'
  - 'Wow! This was a pretty tough one. We parked at the lake and walked up along the creek, then went cross country. GPS signal was poor, had us going all over! This must be really tough in the summer. Finally found it! Cache in good shape. Contents sparse, so took nothing, left a Hot Wheels. Thanks for the workout! Mrs'
  - 'We were in the area, helping one of the geocaching team move from Bloomington back to Ohio. Very hilly around this cache! Took something and left a dollar ring. A great hike and a great cache. Wheres North'
  - 'Actually, this one was relatively easy to find. Quite tricky to walk there, though, need a bit of mountaineering spirit I guess, but the cache was right where the GPS suggested it would be. I drove around the area quite a bit in my car, trying to get as near to the spot as possible. Managed to get within miles of the cache. Parked my car, hiked up a steep hill, down a ravine, crossed a dried out river bed, up another steep hill, and there it was. Found a scary skeleton along the way hope it wasnt you, Dutchboy?? All in all, the army put me through worse. And at least there was no drill sergant shouting at me. Anyway, the cache is in serious need of maintenance. Next one to plan a trip there, please bring a medium sized container with you, the cache needs a new one.'
  - 'Need to get on the correct trail at the beginning. You can waste a lot of time on trails that dont get you close enough.'
  - 'Related Web Page I found the cache at I took a little different approach to find this one. I parked miles from the cache. In doing so I made this cache a lot more difficult and even a little on the dangerous side. One thing for sure, I had a lot of fun getting to the cache and enjoyed the challenge as well. I was going to place a travel Bug in the cache but upon finding it I decided to move on to another cache to place it. This cache is in serious need of some maintenance. The new logbook is in fine shape but the cache leaks and has holes rusted through it. If I had brought a container with me I would have switched it out. Even the buttons placed in the cache were starting to rust. I took nothing and left a State Quarter. Nonetheless I had a really fine time. Thanks for the challenge. Cache On!'
  - 'and I found this cache EXACTLY the same way as Team J&K. We parked at the lake near where the trails start, . miles from the cache. It wasnt until after we left the cache that I figured out what had happened. The trail is well marked. Its so well marked that when the trail meets the creek bed that you FAIL to notice the path splits here and there is another trail on the other side of the creek. Before this point the trail has well placed markers made of good wood with colored arrows, at the creek it doesnt. So you end up walking straight ahead on the original path. On the path you are supposed to take there are numerous bike tire ruts and occasional litter. I dont think that the trail you really end up taking is marked by those responsible for the area, but others wanting to have a good riding trail. What happened to us and I walked on the original path until it seemed we would get no closer to the cache. Our GPSs said we were . miles from the cache up the side of a very steep and rather tall hill. I couldnt find a trail anywhere near there so we had to make a decision to bushwack or not. We went back a little way to the creek bed where the trail DOES cross it. I walked a feet or so down the creek until I estimated that we were closest to the hill we needed to go up and that it was at its lowest grade. We went inland. The grade was about degrees so that was a pretty good hike to get up to the top where of course we found we had to cross a large ravine. At this point we were privaleged to see the falling of a very large limb from one of the large trees, no wind or anything, it just went. We were about feet away, what a crash! I wonder if it would have made any sound if no one was there to hear it? HA HA! We followed our GPSs through the brush until we came to the cache. I spotted the cache as its in plain site. I had Ginger go down and sign the log as I then went around the top of the site looking for a trail that I knew had to be around there somewhere. I did find a small trail that we followed and lost and found several times. Which eventually led to the forementioned riding trail. It was a LOT easier going down than coming up! Interesting start of our cache day and it took a lot longer than I thought it would. Thanks for fun cache!'
  - 'First cache of the day. Nice little walk. The way we came in it wa a little hard to find the trails back out. Ummm...I missed the right trail going in but was still a nice walk all the same. Took nothing but left behind some geocaching pins. The contents are soaked except for the log book which looks like it might be a newer one as the old one still in there is ruined. It is laying on its lid now to keep the water out and that should help. Ginger'
  - 'I think I came in a different way than most. I parked near a lot of old pickup trucks and bushwacked to the cache. It was a short but steep walk. I found the cache with no problem. It looks like an animal has chewed the top of the container a little so some water was getting into the cache. Thanks for placing this cache in such a beautiful area. St. Peters, MO'
  - 'Great area but was it ever HARD. We started at the lake seemed easy enough for awhile. Then needed to leave the main trail. Not bad. Then had to cross a creek and climb a hill. J found the cache with little problem. Then our Etrex decided that it didnt want to play dense trees? so there we were with no GPS, not sure what direction to go, and no real idea how to go back the way we came. GPS Gods gave us a break and we got the signal back after several minutes so that we could head back to our waypoint where we left the trail. We arent sure at all that we started where we were supposed to but we think this was plenty hard for stars. Thanks for the hike and the interesting area we cant believe how lost we were within city limits!'
  - 'Related Web Page WOW! what a hike! I dont know if I started in the right spot or not. Started in on some steps. I followed it back in and after min. of hiking was taking me the wrong way. Started to bushwack and came to a small stream and what looks like an old bridge pier. GPS showed up and up we went. That is an evil hill. Had to stop and rest a couple of times. When I got to the top looked like an old Rail Road Grade bed. Followed it right to the cache. I was standing on the old rail road bed and could see the part of a red can down in the vally. Nice to have it partly covered, and partly open. Hate to put this much effort into finding a cache and not be able to find it. On the way in I jumped two deer and eight wild turkies. Took a J. S. Bach CD and left a stuffed animal. I made a way point and it showed . miles to auto. I traveler farther than that. Trip back was easer. Except for the evil hill, I could have crashed and burned real easy here. This cache is under rated needs more stars! I am glad I DID IT. Thanks'
  - 'my first! i found it late in the day and was the second to be there today, just around sunset. griffey is so close by, and yet i always seem to pass it up to go to the hoosier or further south on the knobstone for long day hikes. it was nice to get out to this area for a dayhike, especially before it snows tomorrow! the descriptions of the up down hills are right. it is a bit tough, especially with spring mud coming on. i saw several deer and the first flowers of the year beginning to stick their heads up harbringer of spring . took nothing, left nothing. signed log. cheers! bog dog'
  - 'This was my first cache ! I thoroughly enjoyed the hunt. Although this was the third attempt to find this cache. On Sunday, January our first attempt my wife and I went out. Going up a steep hill, I decided it was best to let our dogs off lead so we could use our hands if we needed to. Samson our Lab Retriever mix decided it would be a great time to get additional exercise. This concerned his mistress a great deal. A decision was made that we should return back to the car, in the hopes Samson would meet us there. Well we walked about minutes and Samson joined us again. But the wife wanted to call it quits for the day. Another attempt on the cache was made on Sunday, February This time we kept both dogs on leads the entire time. But I believe that I might be navigationally impaired. I studied and studied the topographical maps prior to this expedition, and we climbed the hill I thought where the cache was. Much to my chagrin, the GPS showed that we were . miles away from the cache. My more sane half, also known as my wife was starting to feel her ankle muscles, and was concerned about falling in the terrain. Discretion being the better part of valor, we returned unsuccessful with dreams of discovery at a later date. To note though, Samson was quite unhappy about the fate of being on a leash the entire time. Today I made the assault on the discovery of this cache without my partner of years being with me. It was just Samson and I. Which turned out to be a good thing, otherwise my wife would probably never attempt a Geocache again. It has been confirmed at least in my weary mind that I have a serious navigational impairment. Along with a serious shortage of patient planning skills. I wont go into the details of the route Samson and I took to finally arrive at the route. But we did manage to climb up some rather steep grades. Samson was on lead the entire time, and after today, I dont think he ever wants to go for a walk in the woods again. The way out was quite interesting as well. When I was a kid I remember going head first down a hill on a sled. Today I went down a hill head first without a sled . Nothing injured but my pride. I had a great time. I might become a Geocache addict. Anyhow, I took the plastic Viox bag, and I left a Leader Dog for Blind sewing kit. Great Job on Cache placement. I enjoyed this search immensely. By the way, my GPS read dead on in regards to the coordinates.'
  - 'We found the right place to park and made this one easy except for one steep muddy hillside. The container was out in the open and little teeth marks were in the top, plus everything was scattered. I put everything back together and left you a new pen. RATED Hiking Boots'
  - 'Amy and I found the cache after a considerable amount of hiking as we really didnt know where the best place to start would be. We happened to take a difficult starting point which made our hike much more grueling. We left a parmaceutical bag and took the Luke Skywalker figurine. Andy Matthews amos&andy'
  - 'I dont think there is an easy way to get to this one. Team Dragon Along came on this after a nice climb. This was a unique place to hide a cache. I took nothing and left nothing. Thanks for the hunt.'
  - 'We found our first cache...first to find...on the first day of the new year! what a hike, I dont know if it was us coming at it from the wrong direction or it just is one heck of a hike. After sitting and resting in the nice peaceful hole we took the Uruguay Box and left a USA air freshener. Going back was a little easier catching the trail going down the hill following the creek. It was cold but the hike warm us up so much I took my gloves off and lost one. Thanks for the fun. Oh yeah dont forget to put a log book in.'

  - 'TFTC. Were were in the area before the gate was closed. Saw Muggles but didnt have any problem with them. Using for Georgia Back to School Challange'
  - 'The good news is, we found the cache, which is in good shape, and we completed the Georgia Back to School challenge requirements. The bad news is, we had a run in with some fairly unpleasant muggles near the cache site. Heres what happened We entered the park near the parking coordinates and we debated about what to do. Our GPSr was pointing down a road with an open gate. Should we park and walk the mile round trip as instructed in the cache description with pounds on our back pounds of baby and pounds of backpack , or should we drive up the road a way to see what we saw? We chose to drive up the road since there didnt seem to be any reason not to. A little way down, we saw cars parked on the right hand side and it looked like parking for a trailhead. In front of the cars there was a big field, and to the left across the road, there was a wooded area. Our GPSr was pointed toward the woods, indicating the cache was about feet that way, so we parked and started to get out. There was a group of youngish muggles in what looked like Renaissance festival dress. One of them approached our car and asked if he could help us. We were puzzled, and said no, but then asked if it was okay if we parked there. He said politely that no, they had rented the camping area and that their cars were parking there. He said that the other side of the park had lots of hiking trails and stuff like that. We told him we were looking for something specific on this side of the park, and wed only be a few minutes. We asked what was a little way down the road and he said about a quarter mile down was private property. Okay, we said. We pulled our car up the road several hundred feet, away from their cars and away from the field that we figured was the camping area theyd rented, and got out. Mr. . headed toward where we thought the cache was. It took Mrs. . a while to get the baby out of the carseat, and when she did, they also headed up the road with the baby picking up every stick he saw . A chunky muggle approached and said wed have to leave immediately, because he was shutting the gate in minutes. Mrs. . ran after Mr. . who was in the woods and hot on the trail of the cache. Anyway, hed spotted its place by then, so it took us about more minutes for him to sign the log and leave the woods. By then, Mrs. . and the baby had gotten back to the car, and yet another muggle approached, asking if he could help us. No, said Mrs. . starting to get annoyed . Im trying to get the baby in the babyseat and that takes a few minutes. Somehow, from there, things got less polite, and the youngish muggle said something about when somebody tells you to leave and you dont, the next thing to do is call the police and Mrs. . said something to the effect of Renting the camping area doesnt give you the whole woods, and he disagreed. By then, Mr. . was back to the truck, the log signed. We unhappily left. When we got back to the gate to that road, the chunky muggle shut it as soon as we drove past. We wondered what would have happened if we had hiked in, rather than drove down and parked beside their vehicles. We seriously doubt that they had any authority to shut the gate, and they obviously didnt have a key to it. We also seriously doubt that their renting a camping area gave them the right to shut down a whole side of the park. We had intended to look for some other caches in the park specifically including the orienteering challenge , but wed lost our taste for that particular park. Maybe some other time. Mr. thinks he re hid the container pretty well and stealthily, but it was done in a hurry. We hope that our muggle friends didnt go into the woods after we left and trash the container. Well put this one on our watchlist until another cacher finds it and reports that its OK. Oh yes, Georgia Back to School Challenge.'

  - 'Thanks for the cache Solar.'

  - 'Very enjoyable cache. I was able to find this one after spending a lot of time on another on the way that I dont believe is there anymore. I love a no frills ammo box in a park that you have to do some walking or biking to get to. Also, I sometimes grow weary telling onlookers just exactly what I am doing and usually give the rare insect story unless I feel they are truly interested. Today I met some folks who would have to do a lot of explaining because they were even stranger than geocachers, They were dressed in costume and acting out a fantsy storyline. see visit link'
  - 'We were so happy to find this cache! The bugs, high water, and heavy tree coverage no GPS reception made us abandon the other caches in the area. But this one we found with no problem. Well, once we figured out which was was south. Took nothing, dropped off Hootie TB.'

  - 'This was the fourth cache find of the day. We had a great day at Cochran Mill Park. BTW, X DOES mark the spot. we took a whistle and bungee cords, left a Spiderman Pez, Pokemon and signed the log. The search took minutes from Cache Me In A Can we stopped to play with a turtle.'
  - 'Out doing some out of home territory caches today with AG southwest of Atlanta, with high hopes of making it down to Brookstone, but we didnt have enough time. Nonetheless, really enjoyed my first visit to this park. Check out the pic AG took of the path through the greenery that entire area looked like a sea or carpet, pretty cool! Anyways, AG took paces that a way, while I took paces not quite that away, and she spied it first. Nice stash! Took matchbook container, left either a cat toy or visor attached sunglass holder, cant remember which. Thanks for the find, Solar!'

Cache Me In A Can & Between a Rock And a Hard Place Parked at the nature preserve by mistake, so had to cross the creek and the road to found the caches. Found all three caches! A nice different touch to this one with the cache being a few paces from the coord location. One more beautiful place found by the GPS. See Pictures Thanks,'

  - 'This one was closer to the X than I thought at first. The only thing is this park is closed on Sunday and had to walk a long way. The gate on the side was open at first and several people milling around so we walked back and when we came out the gate was locked, good thing we didnt drive back there.'
  - 'Nice area. Hit this cache in the pouring rain. The last cache that we hit that involved an X was Hortons Hideaway. Thankfully, this cache was not nearly as mind blowing as that classic cache. Took nothing, left nothing. Signed log book.'
  - 'Enjoyed the hike and the scenery. Very nice spot. Thanks so much...see ya on the trail.. Took a dalmation puppy and left a dollar bill. Thanks'
  - 'Wow! This was our first official cache using our GPS, on our own, without a guide. We werent sure that we had entered the correct coordinates especially when we came to the last feet or so of the X. We then relied on my mothers trusty sense of direction and stick to it ness and we foudn both the X and the cache! We took the Cracker Barrel Peg Game, a Hot Wheels truck, and a small plastic cross. We left a golf ball, a Yu Gi Oh card, and a plastic lei. Thank you for a fun day. We plan to return to Cochran Mill Park to find the other two caches.'

Had a real good day caching, Thanks Solar Kiwicacher'

  - 'Our beatiful Saturday wouldnt be complete without bagging at least two caches, so after getting Cache Me in a Can, we took off after X. And we did it like did it; we hiked through the forest instead of using the gravel trails. A much better experience, we think. Came upon the location and found the clue very quickly and then decided to turn off the GPS and use our good old compass for the final search. Nicely done, , an A one cache. TLC Racing, and us think youre doing a helluva job with this sport. The Treasure Caches Salt Water Key travel bug still resides here and the cache is in great shape. We took Sponge Bob air fresheners and whoopee cushion my favorite . We left surfer dude and pink lizard. Thanks for another great hunt!'
  - 'Thanks for a great cache. You can tell an experienced geocacher placed this cache since he gives; walking distance, visual aids incase of satellite interference and has an organized container. I took the “through the woods route,” so you can see the wild life as well as seeing some of the antiques from a past on the ground. Took the marble travel bug and dropped off a key travel bug.'

Took Cracker Barrel playing cards and GEO decal and left travel bug Lost my Marbles since it would be in keeping with the kid oriented items in the cache. Thanks for the hunt!'
  - 'This was our first time using GPS and was a great experience. Good first time out cach. We had the clues for caches in the area and used the wrong clue for this cach. We found the x without a problem. We arrived at the X and began looking for a buried cach from another clue. What dummies we were, we looked for about minutes then realized what we were doing. Had a good laugh and went on to the second cach. We learned to keep cach information separate. Thanks for making this one easy, it really increased out confidence. Both of us enjoyed the experience. I have been to Cochran Mill Park many times and have camped there with the scouts often. This area needs another longer cach with several waypoints.'
  - 'This was our cach of the day. Took about minutes to find it. Lost the GPS signal due to the heavy tree cover. We had lots o fun and the kids enjoyed the playground at the end.

Now, we admit to being novice geocachers and cant seem to find what others seem to have no trouble finding, but every now & then we get lucky. Not so today. We did find our way to the creek. Im not sure we could ever have found a micro cache in all the briers & broken limbs, leaves & mulch & such. Maybe we will try this one another sunny day.'

Even with his extra hint, it took us nearly a half hour to locate this one. The North coordinate for the final was pretty off for me. I took a waypoint average of readings at the final and will email you that coord in case you decide to update and average with your original. SL and listened to a few trains go by. Thanks, I think.

The railroad spike in the base of a tree near the cache box is actually a benchmark and could probably logged in as such.

Good cache but the ngrs is a I will explain the rating system on a future post on the Ga Geocachers Board. thanks ng'

After a minute search under a hot summer sun, we were greeted by the cache owner who provided us with the additional hint found above. TN Left dart flights TFTC. BBF then gave us the coords for Oh Canada cache. We enjoyed the walk with BBF and his brief history lesson of IU. Alway nice to meet a fellow cacher on the trails.'
  - 'Gave this one over an hour of my time so I can reasonably post a DNF. GPS wouldnt settle on any one bench so I really searched good around of the benches. Coords kept taking me towards front of library computer area, however, there wasnt any benches there. I did search all around all benches, so the cache must be extremely well hidden. They have been mulching in the area so I hope all is still well. I would be glad to get with any other cachers that would like to search get heads together on this on. Williams, IN'
  - 'Third of four DNFs for weekend while visiting Bloomington on trip from Naples, FL for wedding of niece. I looked for over forty five minutes with no luck, and had to get moving as I wanted to find a few caches before I headed back to Florida. My GPS has been off all weekend so not sure where to look on most caches. My southern GPS must not work up north. I see others have had problems, so I dont feel so bad. I wish I had the new cache page as it would have given me a location to look for. My cache page had no mention of a bench. Sorry that I cant come back a look for this one. – Pittsburgh Transplant'
  - 'Ok, I looked for this one on a sunday late afternoon during the least amount of traffic. Still I was being watched by patrons of the computer labs with puzzled faces. I found a spot, but no cache. I spent the better part of an hour on this, I dont give up very easly, but I did on this one.'
  - 'Agree with Steve. We did not find this and while we are not the best cachers by any means we couldnt figure it out. The spot it brings you to is interesting but where it looks like it would be wouldnt put me at D We searched them and couldnt find it. We must have just missed it.'
  - 'I didnt find a cache at the coordinates where there are plenty of difficulty hiding spots , and my instincts tell me that what I did find point to a puzzle offset or mystery cache. If the cache is at the posted coordinates, Ill have to think through what kind of hiding method would raise the difficulty such.'

  - 'I really hope people in N.C. still realize what beauty they have all around them. It is so easy to get get caught up in every day life and forget to look around. Thanks for showing us your area, In days we saw, via geocaching, what would have taken us years worth of vacations to see otherwise. Cant wait to see the rest of it. Shonky corrds or not we had a great time even after an occasional shellacking. Ta Cobber. Goodonyermate!'

  - 'We found the dam but I was skeptical that a hike down was needed. I was wrong. JR found it after I found the hint. Great little area and good spot for a cache. Despite the wet weather, there were people camping along the river. Never really enjoyed camping in the rain til we got our camper. Now it is much nicer. Too bad we never have time to go camping... I digress sorry! But TFTC!'
  - 'I made the scramble down the bank while my caching partner remained skeptical that it was necessary. After searching for awhile and having the clue passed down to me, I found the cache. TFTC!'

  - 'Found it this afternoon with my wife and month old son. This trail gave us a chance to try out my new Kelty baby carrying back pack and it worked like a charm. We missed the trail to take us along the creek so when the GPS said feet down this steep hill we decided to go slipping and sliding. Looked in one spot and it wasnt there. Tried another spot and there it was. The wife wasnt feel well and I wasnt sure how long the loop around was going to take so we headed back the way we came to find the other two caches close by. TNLNSLTFTC!'
  - 'of on an interesting loop of western NC. Not sure why I havent attempted these four area caches before, but I got them all today. There is now a large fallen tree next to the bridge, making it easy to cross the creek. Found the cache quickly in the second spot I checked. TFTC!'
  - 'This was the last of the day. Found without pictures. I think it looks like the Valving area for possible trout farm below. Notice all the overfills and ponds below!'
  - 'This time of year you can wade the creek with the bridge out and it feels great! Nestle the geo dog led me right to the cache and I didnt even have a GPS with me. By the way, I have hiked the whole trail loop recently and it is fine so ignore the trail closed sign. T dice L clip'
  - 'I tried in vain to find the first Manmade cache. This time walked right to it. So much easier when the cache is still there. Left cache clue sheet to use as a temporary log sheet. The bridge being out is no longer an issue. Should be easy to cross for most people. Made the loop on to the waterfall cache. Great time of year to be in the woods! When is it not though!'

Then I read the previous cachers note and found the container right away. I had a few TBs that I wanted to drop off, the container was barely deep enough for one of them, but they all fit. I also left a couple of marble like items and took a toy for my son and a small necklace. I just wish the weather was a bit nicer today, I might have ben able to convince a couple of proto cachers to come along. Then again, it was kind of nice to get away for an hour or so, and I think Im starting to like caching in the rain. TFTC'
  - 'Stopped by this morning to grab the Redwood Fire Truck Bug. Found the cache intact, but it had obviously been muggled. There was a tree down very close and a lot of broken branches. Guessing from the wind storm earlier this month. Clean up of the downed tree and branches appears to ongoing. I gathered the cache and some stray contents and hid it all behind a tree roughly thirty feet directly up hill from the muggled location. This should preclude further mishap. Curiously the muggler s left the fire truck and it mission card but took the travel bug tag and what ever had held the three pieces together. And ironically, the falling tree missed the cache but it is a fair guess that it didnt fair so well against the clean up crew.'
  - 'Found it on a nice day in Monterey. TFTC'

  - 'Took my three nieces and nephew to find this but it wasnt there. My son and I found this one before, but its no longer in the same spot. I think someone may have taken it.'
  - 'This was our first CA. cache found in Sept. however, today we took a friend, and let her do the work. At the same location where we found the cache, there was nothing there. Perhaps someone misplaced it nearby, or it has been taken. We enjoyed it the first time we found it and left a sheet of stickers.'

  - 'This one took me longer than it should have. I spent way too much time chasing the arrow on the GPSr under the pine trees. I finally got smart and walked out to the road where there was a good signal, then just walked on the road until the arrow pointed at degrees. Walked right to it after that. Nice cache, in a quiet, serene location. Nice break from all the traffic downtown.'

  - 'GPSr was all over the place, so we had to resort to the hint, that made it easy. We sat on the tail gate and watched the cutest family of newbie geocachers searching a football field sized area.

  - 'Showed my son how to Geocache with this one. Nice beginner'

They are his favorite toy and we cut down the two Douglas firs by our house a couple years ago so he hasnt had many to play with lately. The find was easy so I sat in the shade, enjoyed the peace and quiet for a bit while and threw a pinecone his direction every now and then. Good fun.'

When O got out, the GPS started pointing me see away. FOllowed the GPS and quickly lost signal. Did not regain signal for some time. I searched the area the GPS took me to, but realized it was wrong. I put away the GPS and went with my instincts. I went back to where the car was and walke dthe feet in the direction I was originally pointed. I found the cache within a few moments.

  - 'A little late logging this one. I was on my way to an appointment and decided to avoid the back up on Hwy It oured to me that I hadnt done this one, so it made sense to make a quick detour and snag this one. Some guy was checking out the street lighting across the street so I had to use my geo stealth and do it discretely. I walked by, casually snagged the cache pretty easy hide , and meandered through the trees another couple hundred feet where I couldnt be seen. Unfortunately, being a spur of the moment thing, I wasnt prepared with any appropriate trade items. Loved looking at the collection that was there, but TNLN. Thanks for the regular sized cache in this little micro sized park.'

  - 'Nice area! Seeing that the Jeep was hiding in this cache we took off early to find it. We left the Aall Star Geocoin and a couple of marbles. Thanks for the cache. We had never been beyond the Jacks Peak park entrance on the road leading into Aquajito. We saw a doe and her fawn there. The Plunketts'
  - 'Easy drive by in a less travelled part of Monterey! Hit this one on the way back up to my work location in San Francisco to drop off a Jeep TB Nice hide, but the poison oak has the potential to grow into a big problem! I inadvertantly brushed my wrist over a foot high sprout while replacing the cache, but no issues yet... If your kid has the propensity to run at a cache when they see it, this isnt the one for them theyll trample right through the stuff.'
  - 'Visiting from Wyoming so was unprepared for the theme of your cache. Pretty corner. TNLN.'
  - 'FTF! We saw this listing from our hotel room while investigating potential cache spots to explore today. Gave us an excuse to pop out early to get away from the noise of the clog dancing pachyderms in the room above us. Neat area and thanks for the out of town FTF. There did appear to be some small poison oak plants near the cache that could be avoided if you step carefully. TNSL. Left glass fish bead'

  - 'Another nice little park! I love discovering all these little hidden pockets of green. All the meandering trails made me go too far initially and into some PO, then I circled around and went another way. After hubby pointed out some deer, I went another direction and finally found it. Nice hide! Took turtle TB saw seal TB, Spidey TB is missing ; left purple plush and Jackalope TB. On the way out, hubby stepped in poop non deer , so watch where you walk! TFTC'
  - 'Out with vinotym and family to drop a couple TBs that came from the East Coast TFTC'
  - 'There is poison oak all over this park, but there is a clear path to GZ narrow and hard to see . The coords from Ronus log helped a lot...TFTC!'
  - 'Took the poison oak tour of Monterey today to find caches. On the way to this cache, we came across an abandoned fire in one of the fire pits. Put it out with water from the abandoned beer and soda cans we found on the trail. Besides, the careless humans, lovely little park. TFTC.'
  - 'N W'
  - 'This was a little tough to find, the kids basically gave up, so I had to put my geocaching skills to work to find this one. And it was a good little walk from the camp site, by good exercise for all.'
  - 'We re visited this cache today, in an attempt to locate the travel bug that is listed in the inventory. The TB wasnt there, but the cache is still there, and ready to be discovered by other geocachers!'
  - 'Searched all over for this one, couldnt manage to find it. By the way, lots of poison oak around the site. Wear long pants.'
  - 'Went out with the mini cachers and found this. TNLN SL TFTC'
  - 'attempt for us after reading the logs and found penqvin had logged new coords I tried using those ones instead and it brought us to it! Theyve helped out before on other ones. Great helpers!

  - 'My first geocache find. Little bit difficult to find for a newbie, but a nice introduction to the hobby. A great way to end the decade.'
  - 'Cache is good to go, although it is likely that some local kids know about the hiding spot. A sparsely furnished ammo can was still there, though...'
  - 'on our trip from SF to LA a nice cache'
  - 'Found this one the same day that Lady Bach and Nerdy McCool found it in disarray put it back where they had put it. Needs in log and may be a different home. TFTC!'
  - 'Took a short while to locate the one, but it was totally worth it even just to see the container! My four year old boy was excited to find a few LEGO pieces and we left some Boaralk ride tickets in the cache... Happy geo hunting!'
  - 'Found this cache. It was open and the contents tossed around. I took a little yellow dinosaur that I found on the ground by the open cache and left a foam heart, because this cache needs some TLC! Nerdy McCool placed the cache back to where it looks like it should have been in the first place. Theres no log book, so I left a sticky note of our find.'
  - 'There was a heck of a lot of Poison Oak in the area and even some right next to the cache. I wouldnt be surprised if I have a rash in the morning! I didnt see any clear way to get to the cache site without getting extremely close to the poison oak so seekers beware and dress aordingly.'

  - 'Tough find. More of a stump than a tree. Took yo yo and left bottle opener.'

  - 'Nice walk through a very busy park lots to do for big kids and little ones found the cache quickly. Be careful the poison oak is in full growth; at the moment it can be avoided, soon enough the approaches will require more evasive skills.. TFTC TNLNSL p.s. no sign of tbs when we arrived'
  - 'Found it. Thanks!'
  - 'Much PO but fairly easily avoidable. Found cach under stump not tree, but hey, a find is a find. Thanks for leading us to this pretty area. IN JOY'
  - 'Found with mini mim after playing on the nearby swings, watching some little league baseball practice and admiring a lone basketball swish the net. Nice neighbourhood seems to have been good fishing at one time, since the houses seem more than some beach side shacks but maybe my romantic ideal of fishermans home is outdated . TNLNS . TFTC.'
  - 'Fun find! I thought it was in a hollow log nearby, but I was too scared careful to stick my arm in there. And yeah, poison oak nearby, but not at the cache site. Leaves of three, leave them be! Theyre a little shiny, too. Snagged Leapin Lion TB.'

  - 'This was a rainy, wet day and we got a little soaked doing this cache. The really cool thing though was that we thought the cache was still a ways away and we decided to stop and see what the best approach would be. As we stood contemplating, our GPSr started counting down until it got to At that point Hubby reached down and found the cache right in front of him! What great coords! Traded TBs here but the one that was in the Spidey one wasnt in the cache. Also took some change and left a nimi frisbee and a small snake. TFTH'

  - 'Nice hide! Traded Spidy TB for the Gavin flame TB'
  - 'Looks like the cache may have been found since the last cachers visit. It was out of its spot, and readily visible. However, all looked to be in order in the cache. Tucked it back into its spot when we left it, but the owner may wish to check to see if it is hidden as intended. TNLNSL. TFTC.'
  - 'Nice park and trails. Found cache quickly although it was hidden well. Left behind a Bug for the next person to find and tried to hide the cache so it is not visable. TFTH.'
  - 'I used a short lunch break to walk up here from Casa Munras. Thanks for the nice walk and the nice little park. I had only minutes left to search and couldnt find it. My GPS pointed me to a location that was obstructed by a fallen tree. May be that was the reason?'
  - 'Lots of poison oak! My son took a metal object and left tatoos. This is a nice little park. Thank you! Morris Family'

  - 'great park, my daughter loved it as we had to spend a half an hour on the way in and the way out playing on the swing. The site was easy to get to but there was some PO on the narrow trail in the last ft of the approach. TFTH'
  - 'A little harder to get to than I thought at first. I circled the general area and pondered where to dive in. As I did so, a likely spot presented itself and sure enough there it was;'
  - 'Arrived in Monterey, from MD, around & after checking in at the hotel went caching. This was one of finds. TFTC'
  - 'Youre right no poison oak near the cache. But watch out for it on the way to the cache. Thanks for bringing us to the park.'

This time was fairly easy but fell twice because I stupidly went in shoes with slick soles. Took Thumper, left a Shrek watch. TFTC, I love this park! For those who are hideously allergic to poison oak like I am, heres a hint enter from the park baseball diamond side of the park.

We replaced it as we found it, but are concerned that the cache seems somewhat unstable and may slip from its hiding place. TNLN. TFTC!'

The hide was made more difficult by the LARGE tree that mother nature dropped RIGHT ON TOP of ground zero. Finally found it, retrieved it and signed the log. We hid it well but I fear that it might get disturbed by the park crews when they come to remove the tree. Thanks for a fun cache!'
  - 'My wife and I found this cache on New Years Day. We agree with the other logs that it is a nice quiet little park with good trails. We are concerned that the soft sandy soil supporting the cache will erode away with the next big rain, and the whole thing will end up down in the gully.'
  - 'Found it. cache of the day. We took along a muggle to introduce him to geocaching. The silver silverado TB was not in there.'

We left our friend Homer Simpson. Now time for a nap!'
  - 'If you like a challenge, DO NOT decrypt the additional hint. We spotted this one from feet away. But at this point we GigiMae and Bernd_das_Brot were just glad to find anything today. After a very frustrating start three misses this one broke the jinx. Our first and only find today. Clever location. A very intimate spot in a rather busy park. Took the Beatles tape we are both big Beatles fans and left Homer Simpson figure.'
  - 'Found without too much trouble. Of course took a longer route than necessary, but then... isnt that always the way? TN L Paradise in a jar, Sig geo tag'

  - 'Nice park on a beautiful day. Cache is hidden so that we could find it easily even with the ball players using the field not far away. Nice place to bring a lunch, or have a big family bar b que. I was impressed with the design of the large grill. Took Doggy Dog Tags travel bug and enjoyed taking photos of our dog Buddy when we got home to Tempe, AZ Signed log at Gordon & Barb'
  - 'Visiting from Arizona. Had a great time finding caches around the bay area. TNLNSL'

  - 'YAY for ammo boxes! I had a couple of largish TBs to drop off, and this was the perfect spot! Raptor and I came out late in the afternoon ish, which is kinda late to be afternoon, but the sun was still up , and Beernut was with us. Found the cache with no trouble, and wow, was it packed with goodies! Raptor took a snake, and I took the BookCrossing book. In addition to leaving the Library Ladybug and Doggy Dog Tags TBs, I also left a BookCrossing book of my own, and a dinosaur. It is now even more tightly packed than it was before. D Thanks for the cache!'
  - 'This looks like a good park for the various activities available here. It was empty this weekday morning except for the gardener mowing just above the cache. Using the hint I found it easily which I hope kept me out of the P.O. Thanks TNLNSL'
  - 'quick find in a neat park.'
  - 'This was my first time to the park even after being in the area for the last years. Pretty cool hiding spot.'
  - 'TaDa! FTF One of our very few in the past months, no matter what the rumors are. This is a great park in one of our favorite areas of Monterey. We almost had the entire park to ourselves, altho we did see a man with an ARMY t shirt walking out of the park. Who was that geocacher? We took the Always Coming Home Travel Bug and the Duluxe Mini Links and left a koala bear and a heart full of stars. Thanks for providing the excuse to visit this area! The Plunketts'
  - 'Unfortunately I was not the FTF this cache. Apparently someone got there minutes before I arrived. I believe I saw the couple because they were leaving the area of the cache when I was walking up. Anyways great spot and a nice hiding place. I took the racing TB and left a rubber snake. TFTC.'

  - 'Finally.........Thanks to dragonwest help we found this cache. Coords are WAY offffffff! feet. You can tell people have been walking all around in that area. Signed log, no swag in cache but we left a coin that says Blaze your own trail thought that was fitting since we did blaze several trails to gz... times a charm for us'
  - 'Yay! A smiley for me, today! The original coords are quite a ways off. I gave up looking in the usual spots and started wandering around and thats how I found it. Yes, it is there. Nice log with entries going back to at least Thanks for the cache!'
  - 'attempt and no cache! After two other cachers found this one we went out with more eyes today and looked in the places we thought it would be since the coords had us at the only spot to park our car to the right of the no trespassing sign and nothing. We looked in a radiace of feet to feet still nothing. Thought for sure we found it since last time the grass was so green and over grown and now its all dry and flattened out. Darn, we sure could use a good hint........ pleazzzeeee.....'
  - 'My second find of the morning. Clues in the description are perfect! Got this one faster than Surf and Stealth. TFTC'
  - 'Was a bit hard to find but in the end it was my geo sense that located the cache. Clever hide. TFTC'
  - 'Searched for this one a little while by iPhone funky reception today with no luck. Then Seahoob wandered off about ft away and found it! In great condition, but needs some swag. Sorry, I came unprepared today. TNLN SL TFTC!'
  - 'Second visit without success. Ill read the log entries and try again. A resent find tells me that nearby construction hasnt really affected it. Its a toughy!'
  - 'Out escaping the Valley heat for a few days with Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. we looked and looked and looked. Even after expanding our search area we came up empty handed. Oh well, maybe next time.'
  - 'Found on my walking tour of Carmel! TFTC!'
  - 'dont think its here both me and swimmergirl think its missing. Better check on this one.'
  - 'Didnt have any luck finding this one. Read in the other logs that the coordinates were off, so expanded our search. Interesting plug in telephone pole caught our attention, but once unscrewed it didnt find anything of interest no idea what its for, but obviously not the cache . More accurate coordinates would help; wed want to try again.'
  - 'Found it while out caching with ChevelleFan. A very wet Sunday morning with a few construction workers out n about when we made this grab. Coords were off but we made the find after expanding our search. Great view! TFTC.'
  - 'Found this while caching with . Coords were off, but the description says it all. Our timing was perfect, no muggles at all. TFTC'
  - 'We looked on two different days. There has been a lot of tree and brush removal going on here. We wonder if it has been removed or if were daft and need to try, try again another day.'
  - 'No luck, but what a trip it was to tool around the teeny streets of Carmel. Although were locals, we tend to stick to the commercial section if we go to Carmel at all . Thanks for the tour! Well try again, if the cache proves to still be intact.'
  - 'Darn checked all around in a fairly large circle, but no dice. Since somebody else found it the same day that I hunted for it, its obviously still there. Better luck next time. Hey, but I did enjoy the crazy up down grades on my walk to get here.'
  - 'MLady and I were out for a day of caching with Kobe and Lola and relatives . Found this one about feet from GZ. Good thing MLady has geo sense.'
  - 'Found by Dresselmania! ! Found in obvious place a wee bit far from posted coordinates. Maybe our GPSrs were off? Always better to be lucky than good! TFTH!'
  - 'Walked by it twice and thought to my self dahh there it is!'
  - 'Not much luck for my self imposed twenty minute search limit. I covered the ft radius of zero thoroughly but came away with nada. Unless this find requires a pipe wrench our devises arent reading the same! Disappointed but will eventually get over it! Fortunately I have a therapy session this afternoon! In all seriousness thanks for setting it up and it wouldnt be as much fun without an occational DNF!'
  - 'I looked and looked where my gps told me too. Luckily I took a break and explored about thirty feet away and found the cache. It looks brand new with a brand new logbook so maybe it was moved from the original hiding place.'
  - 'A perfect hiding place for the box near the beach! TFTC'
  - 'We are staying just a couple blocks away and walked down with my year old. Easy terrain, found the likely spot and yet almost didnt look for it because the terrain looked undisturbed. But I bothered to look and there it was. Small plastic container, logbook only and pens logbook was brand new I was the first entry . Beautiful quiet creek and canyon. TFTH.'
  - 'Alas, another blue frownie this time. Zeroed out in a new spot at least, and found a likely hiding place, but the cache seemed to be on a walkabout, or perhaps this place is haunted? With that in mind, here are some likely culprits that may have made off with the cache quote The ghost of a young looking air force pilot can be witnessed over and over again attempting to exclaim something at Los Padres Dam on a dark night. Whichever way, it in all certainty is a creepy phantom that you shouldnt go searching for. quote A lady with a bottle green face has every now and then been observed in a Carmel Valley school after midnight marching the hallways. quote The ghost of a mail carrier is known to have been perceived on a handful of instances in a mobile home in the neighborhood of Carmel Valley. quote A mans body with the head of a donkey may occasionally be made out in a Carmel Valley area supermarket, walking the aisles. Several of the locals say this ghost could be a famous days gone by dweller of Carmel Valley. quote The ghost of a female having letters cut into her hand is often seen shouting at a shrub in Big Pines late in the night. In any case, this ghost unquestionably is scary; one that should be stayed away from. quote The ghost of a strapped up female may regularly be spotted going wild at midnight by a vending machine in Carmel Valley. Obviously, further investigation of the mysterius dissapearance of this cache is needed TFTH'
  - 'No find for us either. Disappointed, but always IN JOY'
  - 'Gave it a good try, albeit with a rather anemic and somewhat laughable iPhone version of a so called GPS. Still, the signal was pretty good, although with an EPE in the double digits, I wasnt holding my breath. Lovely spot all the same, and a corner of Carmel I hadnt explored yet. In keeping with my DNF tradition, Ill include some facts about the location... quote Carmel–by the Sea is an exceptionally dog friendly city. Most hotels allow dogs to stay with guests. Almost all restaurants that offer outside dining allow dogs in those areas, with most of them also offering water. A few have special doggie menus. Many retailers allow dogs to accompany their owners in their stores and many have treats available. Water bowls and often dog biscuits can also be found in front of many stores. Dogs are not permitted, however in Devendorf Park on Ocean Ave. between Junipero and Mission Streets . Dogs must be leashed, except on Carmel City Beach, where they are allowed unleashed if they are under voice command from their owners. The police department takes animal welfare seriously and officers will open cars that contain pets without adequate ventilation or water and will remove the pets and cite the owner. Wikipedia TFTH'
  - 'GPS had us all over, but more than once took us to the same spot which happened to be a tree recently made into a stump. Dont know if it is still in the area, but will try again on next trip down here, maybe with a little hint.'
  - 'Didnt find it. There was a truck parked in the lot with two logs loaded on it. Hopefull the cache wasnt in one of the logs.'
  - 'My wife and I were on a trip down to Monterey for a few days and she allowed me to do a bit of geocaching. I just barely spotted something that led me to look more closely. Fortunately, I had the right tool for retrieval. TFTC.'
  - 'This was a tricky location. The GPSr was bouncing all over the place. Had to use our geosense.'
  - 'The GPSr was bouncing all over the field. Finally, zeroed in on the location. Nicely done! TFTC'
  - 'I had DNFed this many moons ago. Was worried when I got here and noticed that some of the BIG trees had been removed but....I did find the cache! Retrieving it took some time but I soon ad it in hand. Very clever! Nicely done! TFTC for us.'
  - 'out with some family for some caching while the dogs were getting a spa day. DNFed on this one looked for about with no luck'
  - 'We enjoyed our walk up from the Sunset Center winding our way thru the tiny streets and ped pathways following the GO TO arrow. Great fun ! Found GZ no problem then used the ingenuity angle to retrieve the prize. Signed the log and left a glass butterfly. TFTC'
  - 'It took a little driving around to find the cache site, and when we did I couldnt locate the cache. Cam was in a hurry to get on the road home, so I cut my hunt short with no success. I shall return. Camnpete'
  - 'Got this one and forgot to log it. Met up with some dude from the neighborhood who thought we we fools for having what he felt was a ridiculous hobby. Very clever hide. TNLNSL'
  - 'Found as part of a family trip to the area. Father of had prepared paperwork and uploaded waypoints for caches. The rest of the family had veto power...so we only attempted about of what we set out to do. Needless to say, everyone in the group found at least one today. As usual, high tech hide and seek was a great way to see parts of the community that are slightly off the beaten path. TFTC!'
  - 'Somewhat of a challenge to even find GZ. While thinking about how I was going to make the grab, my friend VF took the simple solution and made a quick retrieval. TFTC'
  - 'We enjoyed the drive getting here, and enjoyed the scenery at the spot. Finding the cache was tricky, and retrieving it was trickier without the requisite year old. Took a chess piece, and left an oinking pig flashlight.'
  - 'Enjoyed winding around the tiny streets of the neighborhood following the Goto arrow rather than the map. Found a parking spot at last. Found the cache at the second spot I walked to. T Digital Fish TFTC!'
  - 'Took the scenic route thru Carmel to find it, but real nice place. and helios were on the prowl.'
  - 'With and helios WE dropped of a and took a cool marble because I am a glass fiend. . found this one. The GPS was everywhere but at the zero.'
  - 'Checked the usual suspects given the title first, the GPSr was all over the place. Finally threw out the usual and went for a simpler usual and made quick work of it. Thank Pooh for the honey cache.'
  - 'Went looking for this a couple of months ago with no joy, went back today and made the find. Lots of plants missing, place was really tore up. TFTC!'
  - 'This was of we found on our family morning walk. Great place to walk and geocache! TFTC. Took my year old daughter to be able to get this.'
  - 'Out with on July Decided to do some window shopping and caching. Needed the services of a yr old to retrieve this cache. Fixed it and it should be easier to access now. TNLNSL! TFTC!'
  - 'Went around caching with Jodakry to celebrate Independence Day. This one required a old to rescue. Its good to go now! TFTC!'
  - 'We spotted where the cache was right away. We had a lot of fun caching in your area the three days that we were there. I had a problem in replacing the cache and other cachers may not be able to get to it. I am sending you an email explaining what happened.'
  - 'Found it on our way out of town. What a great series to hunt for while visiting for a couple of days. TFTC and thanks for the series!'

  - 'Well I was quite pleased that I had a with me, she made the grab and was thrilled to have found it all by herself! I was thankful for the small limbs! TFTC, this was a fun hide! PS, tons of banana slugs in the grass just to the right of the cache, if you have a morbid curiosity.'
  - 'Very nice camo and a beautiful corner of Carmel that is not often seen. Thanks for bringing us here.'
  - 'Here for a long weekend to join JoJoCat in her hometown. A little golf, a little caching in the prettiest place in the world. Thanks for all the good caches the golf wasnt bad either!'
  - 'Nice day for caching! Out with Luvnaturrre and ebound. Tough little guy...until you know how to get it! TFTC!'
  - 'True to its rating, we found the cache. Like others, spent significant time trying to extract it. Tried with tools, succeeded without. Go figure. TFTH'
  - 'Very good well hidden cache. Would not be my first place to look but the longer and tore up the rest of the area, I just happened to look at the correct spot! Next item was to extract it. Fearless took over and BINGO, we had it in our hands. Great idea and cache........Thanks'
  - 'For some lame reason I did not have my tool kit with us. made the initial observation after a lengthy two party search. At that point we scratched our heads until we stimulated the sub dura mater into formulating a plan to create a viable field expediency. Voila!'
  - 'Staying at the Pine Inn for the weekend in honor of Ynettes birthday. The morning rain and hail! gave way to a gorgeous afternoon, with only a sprinkle once or twice. What a wonderful area this is thanks for the tour! We searched for this one for a while, and then gave up when the rain started. As we walked away, the rain stopped, I turned around, ans found the cache not exactly where I was looking! It took a while, as I didnt have my full kit and tools, but we managed anyway.'
  - 'No luck on this one today. I guess I just didnt have the right tool. Many potential hiding spots at this location but none with the prize. Maybe next time.'
  - 'This was a toughie and the rain started again which made it even more harder. We ended up phoning a friend for a small hint, then found it but has to use a geo tool to get it.'
  - 'We searched for quite a while in the Acre Wood before we saw the light...and the cache. Luckily, I had the proper caching tool for just such an occasion. Thanks for hiding this well concealed container!'

  - 'Used to play down this road when I was a kid. We would ride big wheels as fast as we could, then walk them back up to the top. TFTC! Took little utility knife. Left dinosaurs'
  - 'This was a new twist on a hide. Thanks.'
  - 'Well, I think this is the last of the ... and Stealth caches. We found them all. A nicely placed set of caches. TFTCs'
  - 'I was sure that it had to be in this one particular spot, and so I spent lots of time there. Then, when I was thoroughly satisfied that it wasnt there, I went over and found the cache. Nice hide, little wet there, though. TFTC.'
  - 'Pretty area, clever hide, glad I had with me to actually sniff it out. I was repeatedly drawn to the ivy, like a moth to the flame, and were it not for her I would probably still be there. TFTC!'

  - 'Had devilish fun directing my sister, , around the maze of streets. She kept saying she hadnt been to this area...at every dead end! We looked a bit harder than we needed to since our coords were jumping at the cache site. Walked through the wet grass needlessly... Thanks for the fair & fun series we had a great time!'
  - 'Thanks for the hunt. Nice drive up and no one around. TNLNSL.'
  - 'TFTC! I was out for a morning of geocaching the morning following the end of Daylight Saving Time and this was one of my searches. Took longer to figure out how to get through the maze of streets than it did to find the cache. Spotted it quickly. SL'

  - 'FTF Great hide. I hadnt been to that area in quite a while. Its always nice to get out and spend time with my minicacher. Easy grap. Took marble left a couple dinosars.'

  - 'prs of eyes looking... we thought we were on a roll... finds so far... no luck... dont think its there.'
  - 'I dont think Id have looked if Id seen how many DNFs had been logged here. We saw a good spot and some loose rocks and figured itd gone missing. My sister found some good holes for hiding a cache in but when she checked them she found that they looked right down into the mens bathroom! So watchout!'
  - 'Nice holes for the cache, but I think someone has taken it. Ill try again next Christmas.'
  - 'I agree with the previous cachers. We found an excellent spot where rocks had been moved. We believe this cache is missing. Boo hoo.'
  - 'I think this one is missing in action. We dodged mugglers galore and found the perfect spot but no container. Might be time to check this one out.'
  - 'I think this ones gone. I found the logical hiding place based on my GPSr reading and the additional hint but there was nothing there, except for some material that looked like it might have been used to hide the cache from walkers. Ill keep an eye on this cache just to be sure I wasnt fooled. Camnpete'
  - 'We even took a few pictures of the most obvious cache location...but we didnt find anything there. So sad. Maybe next time were in the area another years from now .'
  - 'We enjoyed this park, and liked the nearby statues. We dont normally pick up hitchhikers, but the cache hiker geocoin was too cute to resist.'

  - 'I had just finished checking into our hotel, fired up the GPS to see what was nearby when this cache appeared to be just behind me! I found it quickly, but waited until dark to retrieve it this area is very popular with visitors and its not the library. The hide area was fine, but with so many folks flowing through the area you have to be very careful here. TNLN TFTC!'
  - 'What a busy Saturday! The hardest thing here was finding a parking spot. Got to see the neighborhood while looking for a spot. Grabbed one of the librarians spots since it was late and they surely werent needing it. Took cache back to vehicle to look through and sign the log. This almost turned out to be a big mistake because a muggle stopped on the nearby bench while we were signing. Didnt have to wait too long. TNLNSL. TFTC!'
  - 'Nice hide SL LEFT GOLD DOLLAR COIN.'
  - 'Pretty quite Sunday morning. Found the cache faster than it took my wife to wait in line for coffee. She never got any'

Watersnake found this one right away. Q and I just enjoyed watching him go directly in for the catch. TNLN, No TBs in the cache to pick up. TFTC!'
  - 'Spotted after our family potty break, sent Mini to do this boy thing, as boys thrashing in dirty places is nothing to notice. So very nearby muggles paid no attention to us as we made grab. Nice to see jumbo in the urban jungle, well as urban as this touristy place gets. Thanks for the artsy experience.'
  - 'Well, again, our GPS pointed us opposite from where the cache was but found it when we figured out the obvious. Not too much foot traffic to worry about as it was a very foggy morning. Part of the art in the area were the very expensive, but beautiful cars that were in the area for the weekend. Took the Dont tell My Wife TB and left a free coffee coupon sorry, left the goodies at home. The statue of the couple reminded us of a favorite Aunt and Uncle in South Africa...TFTC.'
  - 'Nice hide. Surprised to find a cache of this size in an urban environment. Visited several of the art studios in the area. Thanks!'
  - 'Spotted the cache from the footprints leading to it. People kept walking through this area, some would stop and talk, others would just stand around. I sat down with the cache and no one paid any attention to me. Finally a few seconds when no one was around, that gave me a chance to return the cache. and back to the car. Bold hide for this area, made it fun. TFTC'

Thanks for bringing us here while we were visiting the area for a few days.'
  - 'of found today. Took Geocoin; will return to drop like GC. No muggles at TFTC!'

  - 'Quick catch. Greetings from Noray. TFTC'
  - 'am I was sitting, waiting for the muggles to move off when I spotted something. As soon as the muggles partner came out of the loo and they moved on, I moved and made the quick grab. I was just putting it back when a pack of about muggles came around the corner, TFTC.'
  - 'Too clever for me, I guess! There was also a muggle on a bench nearby giving me the eye.'
  - 'There was a muggle sitting not more than about feet away from this cache, reading a book, however she did not appear to possess all her mental faculties. HeWhoMustNotBeNamed ran interference for me while I retrieved the cache stealthily, and brought it to the car for signing. I did a lot of pretending to talk on the cell phone which was actually my GPS, to disguise our covert activities from inquiring eyes.'

How about from here on out if you see a TB but dont take it you log it as discover, and if you ACTUALLY take it log it! It really is not that hard. I have only been doing this for a short time but have figured it out. Other than that, wow what an amazing spot and great hide. So did not drop off my TB here for fear it would disappear forever. SL'

Both my wife and I were born and raised in Iowa, so wed like to follow it there to see our old stomping grounds! Later edit Was not able to log the TB for some reason.

  - 'One of my favorite beaches on the west coast'
  - 'This is a difficult cache to find and the location is suggestive of many areas where a cache might have been. Chances are excellent that the cache is till there and is in its very difficult hiding place, but once a couple of people who are caching together post a string of DNFs it makes everyone suspect of places that look lik e a cache could have been. I will be able to verify this on January when I am in Carmel. And BTW, Cache Reaper why are using a sock puppet name to make your comments? Afraid to post under your real name in case I am right? Well, guess what. I know who you are'

  - 'Found it on a gorgeous day in Carmel. Were visiting from New Mexico, and enjoying the warm, sunny days and all the ocean views.

We had to take two cars and lucky for me I was in the car that didnt have my nephew in it who threw up all over himself...hes While they stopped in Sand City to get him new clothes at Target, we headed on to Carmel and waited for them at the beach. We had just enough time to walk over and get this cache. I didnt love the iceplant, Ive always hated the stuff, but I did like the container and my mom liked that she found a new place to park to get to the beach if she wants. It was a quick find and well placed. Great weather for the end of December. I love it here. Everytime I visit I want to move back.'
  - 'I went out night caching last night but didnt do as well as Id hoped. This wasnt one that I searched for but I probably could have found it without my flashlight. TFTH.'

  - 'This one had us stumped also! We thought we found the perfect hiding place, but it was not there! Thought someone might be signing the log elsewhere. But then read some of the other logs and decided to keep looking, and there it was! Never saw this container before but what a great idea! SL took Found It geocoin and left an In Our Memories geocoin that I picked up in Marthas Vineyard, Mass in August. Thought this was an appropriate place to keep this young mans memory alive. TFTC , Jeff, Dave and Yvonne.'
  - 'Wow this one had us stumped. We almost gave up but, as usual, when you are about to give up is when you find it. Left a Found It! geocoin for the next cacher. TFTH! Kok Family'

  - 'Found this one with Fredericxx Thank you for the cache'

  - 'Decided to grab a couple after a nice day at the beach. Brought food, no wind, sun just broke out from the typical fog cloudiness, who could ask for more. Did I mention I had gucamole and beer? So after a nice day, it got nicer to get this smilie. Thanks for the surf and sand.'

  - 'Great cache container! It took us a while to find it, but we were determined and our persistence was rewarded.'
  - 'Got it, thanks to the hint.'
  - 'What an adventure! Didnt find the cache, but did get some interesting experiences along the way. Went to get a parking place on a very busy day, and found a gal blocking the only vacant spot with her body and dog! I asked her to move, she replied with a french accent, I am not moving!. There was a huge line of cars waiting. After turning away many frustrated potential parkers, she got her spot. Later we saw her on the beach, frolicking in the sand and surf. However, we noticed, unobserved by her, that seagulls had scavenged into their picnic lunch they had brought and left up on the beach. The gulls went INTO the grocery sack, nabbed the wrapped sandwiches, unwrapped them and ate and or flew off with them. Karma, I say. I was snickering.'
  - 'Liked this one because of the view in the surrounding area. I have a similar one in Louisville that requires a mini Maglite to complete the find. RATED Sneakers'

  - 'With the great weather the beach was a popular spot and beautiful to boot. Left signature . TFTC.'
  - 'Clever container for you hide. Thanks'
  - 'I blame my co cachers on my inability to find this one the first time I looked! Just kidding...a little more intensive search of an area I lightly checked last time resulted in the find. Nicely done. Im getting closer to getting all of this series! TFTH'
  - 'Took a couple of trips back to area from beach where the family was celebrating MOTHERS DAY! Took a rest here and looked hard, even missed it. Then I walked back and brought my oldest son with me... we looked and looked and then the light went on and I took a second look and FOUND IT! Everything looks great TFTGC! Logged from my phone using the Geocache Navigator by Trimble'
  - 'Tricky find, but it is there. Thanks!'
  - 'Good hide. TFTC'

  - 'Here for a long weekend to join JoJoCat in her hometown. A little golf a little caching in the prettiest place in the world. Thanks for all the good caches the golf wasnt bad either!'
  - 'Sorry I didnt log this sooner, it would have saved you a trip. But hey, when your trip is to Carmel Beach, how bad could it be?? Great cache and thanks.'
  - 'Im marking this as a DNF but Im not convinced. Im a little suspicious that it might have been muggled due to evidence of recent ice plant removal in the general area. Ill keep an eye on this one and see if others find it.'
  - 'Staying at the Pine Inn for the weekend in honor of Ynettes birthday. The morning rain and hail! gave way to a gorgeous afternoon, with only a sprinkle once or twice. What a wonderful area this is thanks for the tour! There were quite a few dog walkers going up and down the path, but I just kept shooting pictures, and was pretty much ignored. It did make the search a bit longer.'
  - 'Great container and hide. I was in Monterey to attend my high school reunion Class of Went geocaching between activities. Just after I found the cache, while in a strange position, a fellow classmate walked up and surprised me! Love this sport! TFTC.'
  - 'Our last cache of on the beach. These stairs have really eroded from when I was a kid...so strange. The container is awesome and well loved by AnakinAustin. He wanted to know if it would really work! We didnt see a geocoin in the cache, but it might be stuck at the bottom. TFTC!'
  - 'We were searching in the dark for this one. Only had one flashlight so that handicapped us a bit. I checked my PDA and saw the cache owners note about checking previous logs for the updated coordinates.....and I didnt have the previous log that contained the coords. Argh. Then I got home and saw that the coords were in a LATER log too so we would have had it. Bummer. Spooked the mini Geokasher in that she thought she lost me out there in the dark....so it was time to leave. Well be back!'
  - 'Once we got to the correct spot, the light bulb turned on. Nice spot.'
  - 'This was a perfect time to be in Carmel not only was the sun starting to emerge, but there were hardly any people around; apparently, there was some sort of football game going on today . Ive never seen this item used as a cache container before, but the rest of the crew had. Thanks once again for your caching tour of Carmel.'
  - 'N W'
  - 'Find of Thanks for the fruitful place. TNLNSL'
  - 'I had quickly checked what I thought would be a good hiding place then stuck to the GPS without any success. After checking the previous logs we returned to the good hiding place and quickly located the cache. This was our Stealth find of the day. All are well hidden, though our coords arent that close on.'
  - 'N W'
  - 'For some reason our GPS was pointing to the other side of the path. It may need its coordinates updated. TFTC!'
  - 'Judging by the logs we must have been on the wrong side of the path.'
  - 'For some reason, we had problems finding this one, but finally managed to spot the cache. Thanks!'
  - 'My GPS had me on the wrong side of the path, even after initially searching on the correct side near the obvious place to search, which I should have searched more because thats where I found it. Another nice spot on the beach. We had good nearby parking so we kept it and walked North on the sand. Lovely!'
  - 'Tough hide. We managed to score the loot though. Thanks for the challenge. TFTC SL'
  - 'This one was definitely one of the toughest of the series for us to find today. We spent a great deal of time on the wrong side of the walkway searching. We quite a few people out there. Thanks for the tough cache. SL. Took TB'
  - 'This one eluded me.'
  - 'Talk about distracted I was still thinking about how this series had improved my parallel parking skills when put her hands on the cache. At least some of the members of our group had focus! And then there was Jim... TFTH!'
  - 'That was no heifer, that was a beautiful young mugglette. I was just explaining the finer points of geocaching to her. I believe she was genuinely interested. Great hide... good on for making the grab.'
  - 'found this while El Jim was busy chattin up the nearby pretty young heifer! Fun and fair hide. Roomy cache left Love Bug TB here it wants to visit romantic places. Cant get much better than this! TFTH!'
  - 'Good one, well hidden, muggles all around, even a wedding party....just ignored them and went for it. Think there was more pups playing then people. TNLNSL'
  - 'Not to many people around today so I had plenty of time to look. Walked in circles and even searched through the bushes that smell like dog pee. No luck.'
  - 'I was out for a morning of caching before Daylight Saving Time ends and this was one of my searches. Gave up after about minutes as muggle traffic started to pick up. Another time, maybe after this one has a clue.'
  - 'We arrived at the spot just as people were settling in on the bench above for sunset. We looked around but didnt find it. Well be back....'
  - 'This one really eluded us. Lots of muggles but we still looked around. The coordinates bounced a bit but we looked in a wide area. Finally got tired of the people staring and left.'
  - 'Great hide. Not too many muggles today. More dogs than people. Took the Fish TB. Will get it to a new place soon. Left dinosar. After the find my minicacher and I played in the sand and made a sand castle. TFTC'
  - 'FTF. Thanks for the hunt. Nice hide. Quite a few people on the beach with their dogs but I didnt have to use to much stealth.'

They didnt seem threatening but they would run up to us barking and then stop. Any gesture or overture would send the dogs backpedaling in search of the fastest exit route. We all both sides laughed.

After striking out at nearby Munras we next went in search of some morning coffee and breakfast. Once those basic needs were accommodated it was back to caching . We made our way down along the course and as we approached within the last couple hundred feet, my heart sank. I noticed an encampment up above A guy, a couple of dogs, and a while lot of stuff. We continued to close and the arrow started to swing. We were able to stay wide of the sleeping natives, and navigate our way to the cache, which I spotted immediately. Signed, replaced, and then it was back to the car, and off to our first destination... Asilomar! Thanks for the fun.'

  - 'Took the little one out after his nap today and found this one under the disguise of disc golfers a yr old and a yo with discs . We had no problems locating the cache, in fact it was just sitting right out in the open. We signed the log book, took the Biking Cache Geocoin and rehid the container among the likely original cover. This was our first time seeing this course and it was being used by quite a few people. Used to live in the area and would run here often, nice to see the area being put to such a good use. TFTC!'
  - 'and I came by on our way back to Grandma Katies after a nice day in Ft. Ord.

  - 'dont forget to take paper for this one !'
  - 'Finally got back and had a chance to look for this one. I can see how we missed stage one back in October because it took some time to find. The second stage was back the way we just came so we put it off until we did Eggcellent Day for Caching GC My wife spotted the stage container right a way.'
  - 'My First Multi Cache. made the find, The tall weeds and me not really being able to see where I was stepping was getting to me, but log signed, and had a good adventure in a place I knew existed but never realized how nice.'
  - 'This was my first multi cache. Thanks! It was a nice hide. The thigh high tall grass and multitude of bricks made the search seem like the terrain should have been a little higher because you cant really see where youre putting your feet, and many of the bricks are unstable. Once again, nice hide! The tin is intact.'
  - 'Quick find with my son.'
  - 'Found your caches today. Found stage rather quickly, although due to the work we had to go behind the barricade. Great hide.'
  - 'I found your cache today. I was scared that it could possibly be missing due to the flood waters and the dock missing. After getting closer, we discovered the first stage in place and in great shape. We did have to go behind the barricade fence that is up due to the missing dock, so be swift and youll be fine. The final cache was also in great shape and hidden well. TFTC'
  - 'Found with . Sorry for late logging'
  - 'Stage was very tough!'
  - 'Tough time on the first stage. The second stage was not bad at all!'
  - 'Found with Triple L , , and pinbow in the misty rain...brrr! The first stage had us going for awhile..apparently we accidentally got it stuck and had to do some finaggling to get it out! Off to the second without any problems. Thanks to clem for his two cents... lol TFTF! TNLN'
  - 'TFTH TFTC'
  - 'Didnt find Stage but we didnt have too much time to do the search, the rest of the Miata Club was anxious to get moving to catch a train in Winnsboro after our breakfast at Manuels Cafe. Well come back on our own and hopefully on a warmer morning...'
  - 'Made the grab this morning with the dog.....nice walk along the river. Didnt sign log because it was still soaked and I didnt bring a replacement log with me. TFTC SL'
  - 'we could not sign the log. It was very wet. Needs to be maintenance. Thanks for the hide and ERO'
  - 'Log is soaked and unuseable, ziplock bag is not helping keep it dry...sorry I did not have any bags with me or I would have replaced it.'
  - 'Finally found the final on this one today with RMOIII. Cache is in need of major maintenance, we could not sign log and did not have all of the stuff with us to fix the problem. Nice cache we had a great time looking and looking for this one.'
  - 'Found the first and then made the long sojourn to the second. Log was still very wet so didnt sign it. Cache was still there, though, and doing fine except for the wetness.'
  - 'Log is ruined, needs new ziplock baggie too, everything was compeltely wet.'
  - 'We found this one today with Jones and Dentay , we were unable to sign the log due to it being completly wet and ruined. We didnt have our repair kit with us but we left a yellow star shapped smiley eraser to prove we were there and did indeed find the final cache! TFTH!'
  - 'found but log was wet couldnt sign, so after log is replaced will go back and sign.'
  - 'found it...I THINK...after reading the previous posts, we will have to go back and verify the cache we found was actually the final stage and not another nearby cache. TFTC!'
  - 'Sorry. This is a late entry. Found the cache, but it was soaking wet and not signable is that a word? . I guess I forgot to log it because I didnt get to put my official signature on the physical log. If I get a chance I will sign it at a later time if it is in better shape. TFTH. I love this area!'
  - 'what a shame found first stage but could not locate final stage. MUGGLES EVERYWHERE! plus was not sure what we were looking for. it was hard leaving this one as it was the last one for the day.'
  - 'Found stage one with no problem, stage two was another story. Two bits and myself looked for a long while and got very dirty doing so, but could not come up with it. We will try on another day as it is a short walk from the parents house.'
  - 'Tombstone and I found this one on our way to Wally World this afternoon. We found stage one without any problems.....tombstone retrieved the coords and off we went to stage two. After a nice, short hike, we arrived at GZ and searched all over the area with no luck....coords were dancing around quite a bit, so...finally I decided to give mikela a call for a little hint. Turns out we were literally all over this one... Very clever hide from thefourbucks! Log needs a little TLC. TFTF SL'
  - 'Ollie and I had to go to Wally World this afternoon so we decided to return to this one and try again. We had tried to find it early in the year only to discover that it was missing. Today was a better day and I found stage without any problems. Got the coords for stage and off we go. It was a nice walk to get to stage and no muggles were to be found. After searching a while with our gpsr jumping all around, ollie decides to give mikela a call for a slight hint. Well, with the hint we discovered we had been all over it. We just did not look in quite the right spot. Nice hide from thefourbucks! Log was a little damp but we were able to sign it. TFTCTFTH.'
  - 'took a while to find the first stage, then it took a few minutes to retreive it, muggles muggles and more muggles!, put the coords into the old trusty garmin and realized i have to go back the other direction from the way i wanted to go, so i went on to the other caches and came back and completed , on my way back to the car. The final stage was not too easy but i did find in a short time, very nice area'
  - 'Had a bit of difficulty getting stage one container out of its hiding place, and we were a bit concerned about dropping it and not finding it again. Finally teased it out of its spot, and wandered on down to find the final and another cache. TNLNSL. Thanks for the cache and the smiley!'
  - 'Too many cycling muggles this evening to give it a good effort. I now am sure where stage is since I looked everywhere that it is not and came home and read some logs, so I will come back soon to finish this one. Bad part of paperless caching is not having all those older VALUABLE logs I will be back soon'
  - 'This was most difficult of the day. I had to block male while he made the grab. There were men working right next to where we needed to grab this one. Had to wait on man on tractor to ride off the get another load of mulch and wait for other man to turn his back. Got it took it to another location took picture of coords for next stage and then low and behold three more people walk up. Male side of had to put back and it got more interesting. Now instead of watching two people we had to watch five people. Now my two eyeballs watching five people doesnt work. Finally we managed to get it back to the proper location and move on to the next stage. The next stage was muggle free and boy were we glad after the first stage having so many muggles.'

  - 'First stage was a breeze, discovered together with British, Hummy and . decided he needed a quick break from all that exiting Geocaching, so I got a headstart to stage Unfortunately my GPS put me about feet beside the correct spot. When I was still searching, look who caught up?! Hummy then walked right up to the correct spot! Perfect! SL, TFTC! I had a blast with you guys, looking forward to the next time!'
  - 'Found this one with Mummy Hummy, Daddy Brit and Mr. Nordi. stage was easy to find, but we were a little delayed getting to the one as I didnt feel so good for a minute. But once Mummy cleaned me up, we were on our way. Found Mr. Nordi searching all over the place, but Mummy went right to it. Mummy said she hoped that didnt make Mr. Nordi upset, as hed been searching about mins before we got there. Mummy signed the log then Mr. Nordi left and went after one wed found a few weeks ago. TFTC!'
  - 'Found this one with Nordi After finding the stage and trying to be sneaky while muggles were around, we finally got the coordinates to the final. We were a little behind Nordi getting to the final stage as we had to tend to s needs first, but once we got there, the GPSr was right on target. Nordis had him off about feet, but we got it signed and replaced. TFTC!'
  - 'Found this one thanks to Mr. Hunter. I looked all around the first spot...even looked right at it...and managed to miss it. We felt a little like sneaking around the muggles. Nice day for a walk and a beautiful sunset as we left. Left a stretchy lizard in the tin. TFTH'
  - 'Also found the final cache. Thanks for the fun. Does anyone know what the little brown and red insects are in this area? They look kind of like lightning bugs to me.'
  - 'Nice little walk it was pretty day to look for caches'
  - 'We found the MIA old cache without its top and put it with the new cache. Cant get rid of the old cache until theres enough room in the new though. Great multi and thank you on behalf of some first timers!'

  - 'nice cache, we love caching on the greenway. tfth'
  - 'We must have found the old cache didnt look at the log on geocache, stating it had been replaced , which was last signed by . This cache needs maintance, since it does not have a cover, but is located under a solid object. This cache is about feet from the cord. Skipyrich must have found the replacement. TFTC TNLN.'
  - 'Finally got around to finding stage Great little hide. As we understand, the cache container has been replaced after the original one went AWOL. We tried finding both, but only came up with the new addition. We left a very fun geocoin that fits perfectly. Thanks BUCKS for another great greenway hide. Nothing could be finer than caching in Carolina!'
  - 'Found this one with Cacher Dan today. TNLN TFTC!'

  - 'Found this with Took Nothing Left Nothing'
  - 'attempt at this one. First try a few weeks ago landed me several wasp stings looking for the stage. Not fun. Today, found stage after a hint was provided to me. Hunted for the final stage and found the original container without a lid. It was still hidden somewhat. Didnt find the new container as I figured one was enough since the mosquitos were starting to swarm. Signed slightly damp log. Thanks!'
  - 'Well I did not get this one. Found stage easily. Spent minutes retreaving the small cache to look for stage two. After minutes and about misquito bugs, I finally gave up. Must be the greatest camo I ever saw, as I zeroed out at the point and did not leave one thing unturned, pushed aside or whatever. Got me on this one.'
  - 'This was our first multi stage cache and we really enjoyed it. Had some trouble finding the nano for a while, but it was a good hide. Thx for the cache.'
  - 'Couldnt find the nano. Might try this one later.'

Since he would be in town for a couple of overnight stays was going to squeeze in some cache hunting downtown near the hotel. Well lets just say that the cache density in Augusta is not on par with s home port of W S, NC. Without access to independent transportation he was limited to what caches were within walking distance. This gave only five cache selections. Sacred Heart archived by the local reviewer due to multiple DNFs and no replies from the owner. Riverwalk Walk a multicache of difficulty. Augusta Riverfront too distant for a brief excursion and return. The Godfather of Rockn Soul! a great landmark to visit, quite a few blocks from the hotel but still within walking distance.

Ill come back when I can spend more time on the looking!'
  - 'Found with my brother, . TFTH.'
  - 'Small and semi hard to find..'
  - 'Pretty easy, especially with the hint. Not too many people out this morning so got it pretty quick. there were some pretty nasty looking bugs in the hole, so it took me a minute to get the courage to stick my hand down in it.'

Not to be a bad carpenter, but the GPS we have put us about feet from the cache and kept cutting out if there wasnt a huge, unobstructed view of the sky. On to the cache. Its a great place for a simple cache. Many, many muggles, but traffic was light when we got there, and we snuck in and out undetected. The cache needs maintenance very badly. The log is completely soaked and no names are left. We started a new log with a piece of paper from our memo book and put it and the cache in a ziploc bag. TNLN...TFTC!'
  - 'Lots of people out of a beautiful day but I kept telling my year old where to look and he found it pretty quickly. It was very wet. TFTC.'

The cache was in pretty bad shape, missing lid, muddy log so I replaced the mm with a new one, added a peice of paper for a new log left the old one but it is very wet put everything into a new baggy. There was a ladybug stone inside that would not fit so I left it for a child to find, might just make their day, sorry I couldnt make it fit. TFTH Brae, Ancient & Andromeda'
  - 'Great clues! You may want to come do a little maintenance. The log was too wet and muddy for me to sign. Had fun, thanks!'

  - 'Decided to ride miles round trip on my bicycle just to find this cache! Well, I did ride that far but finding this cache was just a sidetrip on the trip. This is a really nice park along the river. A local radio station was doing a remote just above where the cache is by the Discovery center. I forgot to bring a pen so I took a photo of the cache and I wasnt about ready to ride all the back to Batesburg to get one. Ill send photo of cache to owner. TNLN, only find today. Cheers, Blake'

Went back to the car and got a new container. Put it with the old cap where we found it. E mailed owner about logging, but saw when we got back home that others had logged finding the cap so well log it too. Great place for a hide, this area had just opened up when we moved away many years ago. TFTC'
  - 'Before I went out today, I did not check the log to see Jon and Mikis entree. I too found the top of the container with the geocaching logo on it. They have put it inside the clue area so you can reattach it and try again. This is the second cache that has been on the river in this area that has been muggled. Wonder if it is ever safe. I was there Sunday late morning with few muggles about, but otherwise, it is always very crowded in that area. Maybe somewhere a bit down stream?'

  - 'Did not find it after an extensive search under many of the light pals and near several tall friends. Thanks anyway.'
  - 'I was unable to find the cache. There is a lot of rocks that have been turned over in the area. I have had bad luck with Micro caches at this location before. I think there has been at least three within a rocks throw of this cache and all have been trashed or a least they are not listed anymore. Too many people around I think. I had talked to another cacher who had just tried to find the cache, but was unsuccessful also. But it seems that another cacher found it the same day that I was there. I was there around PM or so.'
  - 'Found it today with ! Thanks for the good hint . Great hiding place.'

I found the parking area by accident – there were lots of empty spaces from which to choose. Unfortunately, none of them were in the shade . As I walked down the trail, I was passed by a golf cart with two park employees in it; the cart was towing a blower to blow leaves off of the trail. Not a bad job for a hot day. They went further up the trail, so I headed into the woods and found the cache as they returned to the shelter – and then I apparently surprised them when I came out of the woods heading back to my car – I guess they werent expecting any hikers in the woods on a hot day .

  - 'EMS and I planned on spending the day caching in the Aiken and Augusta area today. She woke up late. My hair dryer started sparking so I had to wait for her to get to my place with a dryer for me to use. So this even furthered delayed our start. Then we had to check on a couple of her caches. Finally we were on the way. With the way the day started we were stupid enough to attempt doing a Miser cache. We spent over minutes looking for it. This should have been an easy one we thought. The coords were jumping and little did we know that our day would end up with the closest our coords got us we were still showing feet away and the farthest was feet. At some point in Aiken EMS got a HUGE rip in the hiney of her jeans. We were having horrible luck in the Aiken area and decided it was time to move onto the Augusta area. We got to Wal Mart in North Augusta to get gas, new pants and hairdryers. Pisces felt is was way past time to invest in a backup. Next time she may not have someone there to come to her rescue. Didnt take us long to pick out what we needed, but it was another story when we got in line. We picked the slowest line. The cashier had no idea how to a percentage off for the lady in front of us. The lady that came to help her was having a problem as well. We finally got out of there and were able to grab a few in the area before deciding it was time to get to Georgia for EMS to get her Georgia cache and we knew we did not have much daylight left. Even though it was freezing outside and it seemed like from our luck we should have stayed home, we had a great time. Thanks for a cache we could actually find today. We are going to try and make it back to the area tomorrow.'

Good grief. Not sure I could have made it any harder on myself. Found the cache immediately, so at least that was good news. Then I walked a good ways down the walkway thinking it would take me back to the soccer fields. But NO! Had to turn around and try again. Ended up walking through some guys side yard.

After I got over to the area, I was amazed how deep it was right there. I love this hobby because theres no way I would be there in a hundred years otherwise. I just love it. Anyway, made the find and signed the log. TFTH!'

  - 'Thanks Geoholic for the nice hike in the woods this morning. We had a great time. We used to drive back here before they blocked the road off and we started caching. We laugh all the time about all the hides we have walked by before we starting caching. Thanks for helping keep the streak alive. A neatly hidden cache.'

  - 'This one I would not want to find after dark, I went alone today the K Girls had homework to do. Found it with no problems and with no hints Seen evidence of homeless people camping out I recommend you have someone with you while looking for this one. Still a good hide and while looking for it I found myself participating in a tick family reunion Had fun will start carrying bug spray.'
  - 'Found it with Smudge at This cache was our primary objective today, so we werent about to let anything like a freeway get in our way. Assess, Adapt, Undercome. Thanks and Semper Fidelis.'
  - 'Llatnek and I came down for the CITO and this one. We already had the SC Connection. Yea we did this backward, but whatever. We took the WRONG way in and had to improvise to arrive at the cache through homeless alley. Ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Got it at Good cache. TFTH. Took nothing and left a Geopen. Smudge.'
  - 'Holy cow Great hint Probably the most freaked out I have ever been while caching ..... I hike my way in there .... follow the great tip in the clue .... and there are so many good spots here .... I started looking in a few spots and then looked back to the gps and I am feet away so I get closer to gz and I see the cache partially uncovered ... so I do my usual activities at this point and in the middle signing log, I hear someone coming. I assume it was the surroundings that influenced my reaction, but all of a sudden I feel like I am in a panic. I take cover to try and not be seen, but I got this big ole caching laid open and cant get the noise maker inside it to shut up. It is blowing my cover .... I assume. To my surprise the visitor is not a cacher and doesnt even notice me. He turns off the path and goes down to the waters edge. I am lbs and feel adequately prepared for what life tosses me most of the time, but here and now in this moment, all I want to do is get the heck outta here. I finished signing the log and replaced it in the cache, but in my haste, I didnt even finish dating the log. I returned the cache to its spot but didnt take the opportunity to try to cover the container better as I didnt want to disturb the visitor. I did cover it as best as possible with what was there I scamper out of the area like a spooked rabbit, and make my way back to the truck. I get in my truck feeling like an escapee. Now I sit there and think to myself, what the crap was that all about? I am sure the visitor would have been as surprised to see me as I was to see him, but I felt like I was the perpetrator here. So needless to say TNLNSL TFTC I did enjoy the hike but gz was an experience I will remember awkwardly'

  - 'Started out caching this morning with a group of seven cachers about am having such a wonderful time finding some really nice and unusual caches while in Augusta. My greatest and sincerest thanks goes to all the local cachers whos hides we found in this area. You guys did a wonderful job! It was also such a joy running into most of you at the local hangout. Had a pleasure talking and hope to see you all at the next CSRA event we can make. If not see you on the trail. This has been an unforgettable weekend for me and everyone on this trip. We all started out and each one ended with some sort of goal or milestone made. Boogerhill made his th mark, Railroading met her most caches in a day stopping just shy of NanaStone met her mark, Doug made Bripod met and I know all of us met or passed our most caches in one day. I personally hit caches and got the joy of topping that off with a very special shared First to Find on the Challenge of the Century cache that just came out the day before that would not have known about if it were not for a PAF. I still am in disbelief on that one All of which has left a very memorable end to a great day spent with some really special friends. I definitely can say each cache find has some sort of special memory, event or left some mark of sorts I will never forget. From running into the local law four times or more , cachers, other treasure hunters, unexpected wildlife, neat area, cool cache hide or just a good group laughter. TFTC, Harthunter'
  - 'Yeah, having an energetic young birddog didnt hurt with this one. I wasn’t sure how a caching trip with eight people would be; thought it might just be crazy and not very fun. Boy, was I wrong! Don’t know when I have ever enjoyed myself as much and don’t know if ever I have laughed as much. We didn’t find them all as the hides in this area are pretty much all “evil”, LOL but WOW, what creative souls you are. We loved every minute of our trip and will be back to finish the job; Thanks for contributing to our wonderful overnighter.'

It was great to cache with Nanostone, Bripod, the Harthunters, Dougs and Railroading. Nearing the end of the conquest, and merely, coincidentially running into many of the hiders from this area while we were searching for a cache, I can only offer my highest accolades for an area that was well populated with caches and ones that were well maintained. Your efforts are appreiciated. Thanks for the cache. Hope to see you on the trail soon! Boogerhill Today was a personal milestone best as I hit finds since July when I began caching and single caches in a day. Thanks for making today fun!'
  - 'Wow... its kinda difficult to describe how Im feeling right now... well I do have a celebratory drink near by... This morning, of my friends and I, headed out to do a little caching... With almost every cache we were amused and enlightened. Some of the most memorable and incredible caches and hides that we have ever seen! Thank you so very much for all the fun we had this weekend. Everyone achieved personal bests today in some way or another... Most reached new milestones and all exceeded their daily best... We were also fortunate to run into the CSRA gang at a cache and got more names and caches to look up and conformation on an interesting little tidbit we had received earlier from Deckgun... Yes my bones are very sore and tired tonight... and yes, Ill probably get up and do it again tomorrow... Thats just how I roll... Thank you to all my friends and for the effort each of you gave in reaching the goals we did! Thank you to all the hiders who went that extra little bit to make the hides in this area so enjoyable... We will be back soon! Logs have been signed! TFTH! Passed total and managed in a day with yet another wonderful surprise to unfold.....'

As we were looking for the prize a plain clothes officer came up and wanted to know what we were doing. Ollie explained our quest to him and he told us he was looking for someone in the vicinity and asked if we had seen anyone. Satisfied that we meant no harm, he told us to be careful and went on his way. The clouds were of no help to the gps today but once we got our bearings to settle down spotted it. As I was trying to sign the log, most of the birds in the area evidently did not like me being there and proceeded to drop good tidings on me and all around me. Now I have to get my sweatshirt washed. We then hi tailed it back to the car for our getaway. This one reminded me of merryMuggles experience at ASU but at least our cop did not want to write us a ticket!'

Looked on one side of the area with no success, then moved to the other & made the find. What I want to know is, how did those two poker chip signature items get INSIDE the container?

This was my last find for the week. I had searched a couple days ago with no luck. This time armed with a nudge from the Hoot I was able to make a quick grab while I left the RV running beside the road. Finished the week with finds, but whos counting? Many of these were some rather lengthy hikes and quality hides. SL, LNTN, TFTC'

  - 'and I made a quick trip to visit family in South Carolina, Arkansas and Missouri and, of course, got a little caching in along the way. I think that our ‘cache Count’ will be close to for the days that we were ‘on the road’. Tentatively, our mix included Earthcaches I like them! , Multis, Puzzles solved more but didn’t have time to look for them! , Virtuals and an WWFM Event, Benchmarks, and a whole bunch of Traditionals ranging from a gallon bucket down to Nano micros. Also, our share of chiggers and ticks! That was a nice mix except for the latter two. Many thanks to all that set the caches that we “Found”. They are greatly appreciated. Anyone coming out to Oregon to ‘Claim’ the ORIGINAL GCGV Cache And GC GC what did you expect! Cache or the APE GC Cache up in Washington should send us an e mail before they come and we will help them out. We managed to add States to our list of “States where we have Geocached” South Carolina, Georgia, Kansas and Oklahoma. We were unable to find time to add North Carolina, so that State will have to come later. Also, we missed adding Colorado because our flight was late out of Portland and shortened our ground time in Denver to the point that even the two Caches very close to the Airport were not possible! While we were gone, the Flash Mob that we set up in Portland, Oregon took place but we were able to attend the one in Lexington, SC and met some great people there. Would certainly appreciate an e mail explaining where the Cache was hidden so we can learn from our DNF. It is doubtful that we will ever be back in that area again! The area could certainly use a lot of CITO! Cache On and CITO as you Cache! for and'

Im in town with the two geosons who are both still asleep in the hotel room upstairs. The older one is visiting the Jacobs school later this morning. Hope to find a few more today. And maybe Ill be back several times over the next several years. TNLNSL. Thank you for placing this cache!'

  - 'How has this not gotten muggled?! Thanks for the cache!'
  - 'A little misled by the title and description, but nice, relatively easy find.'

  - 'Loved the story about Hermans car! TFTC.'
  - 'Very nice hide, perfect for a hot day.'

The second time I tried to get it I immediately spottet the cache but due to too many muggles there was no way of retrieving it. Today I finally got it! TFTC!'
  - 'I dropped by this site yesterday evening, then again at lunch though short, my colleagues were hungry and bore easily . And then again in the evening. After being there a while the GPSr started pointing somewhere else so I wandered away. And then a big family came up and took pictures with Herman and hung around for a while. With my light fading I waited them out. By this time I had wandered nearby enough that I had a good idea where the GPSr was pointing and, yup, there it was. Nice hide. TFTC.'

  - 'TFTC! Number out of of a late night caching run. I am still so surprised this one hasnt drawn more muggle attention. I love reading all of the history associated with your caches.'
  - 'Happy New Year! And cold New Year!'
  - 'Always hate to be an enabeler. but hey... Took a little run through campus to check on some of these caches. This one now has a new log. I might need to make this one a little more water proof! Please make sure you hang it back as found. you know what they say about things running down hill. Good luck on this one. Might not be just where you think it will be!'

I made attempts to empty the container, but it was stuck, and any tugs just started tearing paper, so I did not sign the log. A new plastic bag would suit this cache well. A nice hide while here on training from Oregon thanks for the hunt!'

  - 'Found it, but unfortunately it had fallen to the ground and some moisture had gotten inside. The log was soaked and needs replaced. Otherwise, TFTC!'

Found an IU chain, silver half dollar, and a purple plastic fish inside...not sure if there was supposed to be a log inside or not, but there was none. Took the fish in exchange for all the change in my purse at the time a big handful of nickels, dimes, and a whole lotta pennies...do what youd like with them . Excellent location and cache!

  - 'About months ago, I gave this a shot with JPlus We didnt find it. and I were continuing our stroll down the trail and stopped off here. I read the description from my Palm, but I swear I didnt see that particular line. Like others have said, the coords take us in the middle of the street. Anywho...... A very nice young man came out from the business to lock up and we talked to him about the cache. He told us where it used to be but he said that the cache disappeared when they did all the renovations for the trail. We went to where he said and didnt find it. is one of the most persistent cachers that I know and he STILL spent another minutes looking. No luck here yet again.'

My kids have been to this place twice. Once was when I was on a caching spree in Southern Indiana. Its a great place or so I hear . I was out on a little cache run to Bloomington today with fellow cachers Professor Zoom and .'

  - 'On a New Years Day cache run with and Go Purdue. Like others, we expected the coords to take us to the cache which is sort of how I thought traditionals worked , but the freezing weather sent us straight to our iTouch GPSrs for addtl info. We would NEVER have found this one otherwise. Container is in great shape, but the item holding it in place is highly visible. We couldnt figure a better way to hide it, so we just did the best we could. Thanks... cant wait to bring our back to visit!'

  - 'Found this one pretty quickly. Because Im not Andre the Giant, I had a difficult time placing it back so that it was well hidden. Anyway, I think I placed it back well enough, but it may need to go a little higher. I suspect that this one will be more muggable now that phase I of the B line is complete. Thanksforthefun!'
  - 'CACHE Fastest find evah! Optometrist Prime was still reading the cache description when I spotted this one. I wondered if the clue was a hint about native versus indigenous species, but no.

  - 'I finally found this one! I looked a few months ago, but I didnt realize until later that I didnt read the whole cache description, and the coordinates were for the WonderLab itself, not the cache. After reading the whole description I was able to spot it from about away. TFTCTNLNSL DJHobby'

  - 'Found it a few days ago but too many mugglers, a little cool for the lunch time walkers made it muggler free today.'
  - 'We definitely missed the part about the coordinates not being for the cache. We were searching in the factory parking lot across the street, but we dont recommend that. Once we understood what we were supposed to be doing, we found it without too much trouble. Glad we didn;t give up. TFTC'
  - 'we were just about to give up on this one, but one more look around and we found it. And we did say DOH!'

  - 'Couldnt find this one but sounds like it needs some maintenance and the correct coordinates posted. There is some construction going on in the area also. So Ill wait a few months before trying this one again.'
  - 'have no clue where this one could be. the darkness could be playing tricks on the eyes though.'
  - 'The Cheif was in Bloomington for a school function and tried to find a few caches. The one was pretty tough, only because it was not at the coordinates. On a cold day, we walked around looking for the correct tree. Then we finally found it! SL TFTC'

  - 'Now it might be best to skip this one for a few days as it is close to some of the construction, and it might not be the safest cache to go find right now'
  - 'Okay, Im logging a found it for this one. I had posted a note earlier about this one needing a little TLC and figured the Bikinibottomfeeders wouldnt mind if I did a little rehab on this excellent cache spot. New container is a cam lock dry box about the size of a cigarette package. Has a mini log book, stash note, pencils, and several euro coins. Picked up the old log and will try to scan it onto this cache site... but as noted, its a gooshy gob o goo! Still a good spot but look out for B line Trail construction folks. STEALTH is now more of an issue than before, so BE MINDFUL OF MUGGLES! Great original work by the BBF team. T gold fish LC left cache SL TFTC'
  - 'Found as part of & now re logging finds under my own account. TFTC!'
  - 'Please replace this cache, it is in such a great location this coming from an out of towner . I found it in the same condition as the last couple cachers. Did the best I could to sign the log. TFTC, the garden is so pretty!'
  - 'Found it, and signed a small bit of the log, despite the condition of the cache. Cache owner, PLEASE replace this cache due to annihilation and nearby construction.'
  - 'Tried to get this one after volunteering at the museum last night, but there were way too many muggles around. Came back this morning and found this one easily I had a lot of time to think about the clue while I was volunteering . Sadly, this cache is basically destroyed. The container is in multiple pieces and the contents were spread around on the ground around the pieces of the container. There is some construction happening in the area which may have contributed to the destruction or the fact that it was just laying on the ground. I picked up all the items and did my best to hide it again. But the cache will need attention STAT! SL, TFTC!'
  - 'Adding maintenance flag.'
  - 'Sometimes, you just gotta slap your forehead and say how did I ever miss this one. As previous logs note, this cache is one step a way from being geotrash. Container is broken and contents are ruined. One small slip of paper in a baggie is serving for the log. Will need replaced ASAP.'
  - 'Nice way to walk off the extra pounds after dinner at the Irish Lion. Good thing and I had plenty of alcohol in our blood to fight the cold weather. The log was pretty wet. I tried to seal it as well as I could.'
  - 'Got it. Fourth of five today. I went back after a hint from . It turns out that and I were staring right at it at one point on Saturday and just didnt notice it. The lid of the container is cracked and there was water standing in the bottom. I emptied it, but it will fill up again unless replaced. One of the trade items was a small plastic fish appropriate. TNLNSL. TFTC. Number verified for me.'
  - 'A cold front rolled in today and burrrrr.... What a nice day to link up with my friend who was passing through town. After dinner at a local Irish pub DELICIOUS! we set out for this cache. We found the local attraction closed for the day immediately began looking and presto!, he found the cache in no time. TNLN SL TFTC'
  - 'This one eluded me, even with some help. Though I wasnt quite as thorough as I might have been in a more secluded setting.'
  - 'In Bloomington for Orthodox Easter Pascha . I was trying for the third today, but no go. However, during the search I saw someone else walking around carrying a GPS. We looked at each other for a minute, then I went over and introduced myself. It was from Terre Haute, looking for the same cache. We looked together for a while, but neither of us could find it. I notice someone else found it on the same day, so I guess it is still there. Ill ask them for a pointer and try again.'
  - 'Found cache easily enough, but container was full of water. Yugsirap dumped out the water, but the log is soaked, so we didnt try to sign it. The lid of the container has a large split in it, so more water will come in, likely later this weekend if the weather man is correct.'
  - 'Logging caches found a few weeks ago TFTC.'
  - 'Found with Muther, Racer and TSC. TFTC'
  - 'Thanks for the cache and location . We thought we had spotted some benchmarks nearby, but we were wrong. Quick find and quick maintenance. Ah, a day of geocaching. You never know what to expect, except that it will be an adventure. A geocaching trip should always start with a good plan. Our plan started out with the intention of grabbing some SW Indiana counties and Delorme pages for those challenges. Good plan, but good plans need to be flexible too. So we changed the attack plan to be a geocache numbers run. Good plan. OK, so we have files loaded on three different makes of gpsrs. We have the Midnight Patriot loaded with coolers, laptops, batteries, sunglasses, gloves, extra socks, a smelly decaying turtle, no wait, left that in the Cache Wrangler boy I wonder what that will smell like in twenty four hours when we return. We are also equipped with valid driver’s licenses, Los Lonely Boys Cd, bags of travel bugs, and a gigantic bag of cheese puffs which I don‘t think I‘ve eaten before, and now I know why…that stuff is like glue. Oh yeah, and two male geocachers. Now when Racer and I hit the road, we have a unique ability to turn off the need to stop for necessities like food and restrooms unless of course there is a cache there. Things change when you bring the male geocacher types along. Especially the year old male versions. They have unique needs, like terlets and food every twenty minutes. So our trip begins. Super_cacher has now taken possession of the explorist and with that ownership he also became possessed. Possessed by the “I know everything there is to know about geocaching” demon. He tried to usurp Racer’s job as navigator. He tried to take over my role as the one who says “what’s next” before we even have the last log sheet signed. He even took over ’s job of telling us when we needed to stop for food. But the really scary thing is that he was better at those things than we are! Yikes, what have I created?? Poor Racer was having technical and mechanical difficulties most of the afternoon, and ’s attempts to take over as lead navigator really put the pressure on her. But in the end, all things returned to normal. Racer navigated us to our personal goals getting numbers, counties, pages, and lots of cool places to visit like covered bridges and courthouses for future reference while the boys stretched out in the back seat SNORING while we made our way home. That’s ok, it left us hours to make plans for a two day trip to Southern Indiana. That’ll teach ‘em. Next stop…'
  - 'TFTC. We were concerned this one might be difficult based on the description but it really wasnt that bad. Theres only one spot that fits the description once youre there. Actually found quickly but log was soaked. We left a small piece of paper in a baggie for a new log until the old one can be replaced. Thought the Iguana was neat. Orale! Found with , super cacher, and . What a long, strange trip its been..... Originally we had planned to log a bunch of new counties but I decided we should just log a bunch of caches, so we didnt make it quite as far south as the original plan. Muther and I even got the boys to go with us. We encountered some obstacles and some frustration, okay not really we mostly just me, but it was a great time as always. Thanks for placing and maintaining the cache for us to find.'
  - 'ORALE! Encontrado con Racer y y Super_cacher. Gracias para todos grande el escondrijos. Gocé del día hermoso. TFTC.'
  - 'Today, the log wasnt wet so much as frozen. Thanks for the find.'
  - 'We found this one simply by using our map and the clue without ever using our GPSr. The log was wet and unuseable due to a crack in the cache lid. The cache needs to be replaced. We added some dry paper. Tom and Killian; Arabia Mountain Nature Preserve; Georgia'
  - 'Cache log and contents need replaced. We drained the container, which had about an inch of water in it, but didnt have time to air any of it out.'
  - 'Great clues. Found this one really quickly, but unfortunately was unable to sign the log because it was literally sitting in water. Definitely needs replaced.'
  - 'Great clues they were a lot of help to me and my sister. I love wonderlab but we didnt have time to go in and look around at all the cool stuff. Great hide! tftc'
  - 'JPlus and I decided to at least give this one a try despite the vague coordinates. We parked, we got out and walked around. I guess we never found what we were supposed to find, because we sure couldnt locate a cache here. Since this place involves almost a full block, it would have been helpful to have our search narrowed down a bit. We looked in about every spot that we felt could hide a small container. No luck here!'
  - 'Broken container, very wet.'
  - 'A quick find after I remembered to follow the description, not the coordinates. The whole family enjoyed a couple hours inside, too. The cache is wet and the log paper is soaked to the point of being pulp. I just managed to make a mark on it. Thanks!'
  - 'Second time finding this one, first time officially. Lid was cracked and wet. Bag barely useable. Left something anyway. Thanks!'
  - 'with warmup on the way for the day. Couldnt sign log since it was totally soaked. Lid cracked and log bag leaking. TNLN Needs maintenance.'
  - 'This log and contents were really, really wet. Have heard of this attraction for some time, first when I was a science teacher. TFTH'

We turned to see a man in front of the adjoining business. What was weird is that wed parked in front of the business and he wasnt there. We announced that we had found it. We spent a few minutes chatting with the guy and he had learned of Geocaching from a previous finder. The business well mostly the guy, really has adopted a cat that wandered inside one day.

  - 'Found with Sapphire on the way to work, FTF. I believe it was just two or three weeks ago, when walking home one day I told Sapphire that corner would be a great one for a cache. As for what the piece of art is, I have wondered that for the past year each day I walk by. TFTC!'
  - 'Batman has decided it would be really something to retire from caching in another years having never been FTF on a cache. So why was he seeking this cache at this morning? He happened to be in the neighborhood and he felt reasonably confident that someone wouldve beaten him to it. After all, his one true attempt at being FTF, running out of the house in pajamas to a cache miles away within minutes of it being posted, was also thwarted. He arrived at the cache min after it was posted and was not FTF. But hes not bitter. So, if by some stroke of genius he had been FTF today, he wouldve quietly replaced the cache without signing it. But his hunch was right he was the third to find. But he enjoyed finding the cache and he really enjoyed meeting a fellow cacher in fact, meeting another cacher is way better than being FTF anyday of the week. TFTC! Find'
  - 'Curse you, Sapphire! Uh, I mean, congratulations!... yeah, thats the ticket... I figured Id be okay if I ran into work and did a couple quick things and THEN ran ACROSS THE DANG STREET and got a FTF... But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I guess I dont feel as bad as Batman, who showed up just as I was re placing the cache. Hes up in the with no FTF. Im just under the mark and got one already. Anyway, good job! TN LN SL TFTC.'

  - 'Not so noisy today! Thanks for the hide.'
  - 'This too had me doubling back a few time. Eventually found it. TFTC.'
  - 'Came out here with a friend, Tyler Shedd whos family owns The Fishin Shedd and the Payne Town boat rental to sweep the peninsula caches. Did the whole circuit in about hrs, and got them all except crappie cache, which we didnt want to chase down the steep ravine and then back up. Thanks for placing your cache out here!'
  - 'Another fun redhawk hide in a little out of the way place. Nice placement. TFTC!'
  - 'After much backtracking and roundabouting, we happily came across this one. Good thing Phil has such good eyes. Left bugwipes. Took the Parkinson Awareness coin....will find a good temporary home for it. Thanks for the cache.'

  - 'Very fun cache. I got the fam to pull the rented pontoon boat into shore and I scrambled up the bank and found after some zeroing in. The cache is dry and comfy in its hide. I forgot my geoswag so did not take the bucks or any of the other nice goodies. Great shoreline here to climb around on.'
  - 'Found this one with the Bloomington Geocachers after our traumatic yellow jacket experience at Cabin Fever. Lots of bushwacking but at least no bee stings! TFTC!'
  - 'We stopped and had a warm beer or two or three or four between this cache and your Cabin Fever cache. None of that helped with the swelling though? Actually some pretty thoughtless people left about cases worth of empties scattered about the cove. MCA swears he didnt leave them here, and in his defense they didnt appear to be his brand. and Kiralira picked up a lot of trash today, here and elsewhere, sadly there was enough here to fill up a few trash bags. Unfortunately the masked geo jerk grabbed your ammo can. The contents are still there, just no container.'
  - 'I was enjoying the company of such a friendly group of cachers and canines today that the terrain really didnt seem all that bad!'
  - 'I found this one today with the Bloomington Geocachers group. ...the cove was, indeed, noisy. I think that is all I can remember about it? TFTC!'
  - 'Found with the Bloomington Geocachers. Thanks!'
  - 'Honestly, I dont even remember this cache anymore. The trek from the yellow jacket nest to the end of the peninsula is a blur of fear that I might be stumbling into another nest , pain that sting wasnt the worst thing Ive felt, but man was it insistent , and beer cans our cache in, trash out bag got pretty full along this segment, thanks to Kira and Mouse for helping to carry the garbage out . Heck, one of the beer cans was still unopened! But I still appreciate the cache, even if I cant remember the details. Thanks!'
  - 'After escaping from the yellow jackets at Cabin Fever, it was nice to start finding caches that didnt lead to pain. And we were at our halfway point on our cache around the pennisula. Quick find led to a nice break of snacks and water. The weather couldnt have been better for sitting around on a log enjoying the surroundings with geobuddies. TFTC!

  - 'Nighthawks coordinates are dead on. So you might want to change your coordinates sometime.'
  - 'It took a bit of lookin, but, on the revised coords, we found this well concealed cache by not overlooking the usual. We left it as well concealed as we found it.

  - 'Got this while picking up a Christmas tree at Lowes. The cache was pretty exposed and so I concealed it a little bit better but in the same place.'
  - 'Got this one on the second visit using revised coordinates. TFTC.'
  - 'Great spot for a hide. Enjoyed the adventure.'
  - 'Found it'
  - 'Coordinates on this one are bad. Use the ones in the logs. I didnt have them last time i went and didnt find this. I talked to a friend who had found it and it was far away from where i was searching originally. Both times i was out there, the posted coordinates led to exactly the same place, close to the parking lot.'
  - 'Despite a helping hand from the Kit Wellner caching addition hotline, i was not able to find this one. Got a fairly detailed description from her for the hide location, and found a few places like that but no cache and had to give up. Neat location, though. Found something else i will have to explore when i have a flashlight.'
  - 'First of the day. There is definately an easy way to get in. After thinking I was gonna come up empty I turned around and there it was. The updated coordinates given in the logs were much better than the given in the cache description.'
  - 'Yeah, no, I mean, er, TNLN & SL. Found with and VortexEcho. Thanks to VortexEcho for letting me borrow his flashlight; it was much brighter than the one I accidentally left in my car any way. Oh, yeah, and it was a pleasant container. TFTH!'
  - 'PM w and After the event, this was our first target. Due to the difficulty and terrain combination, I had left this off my PQ when loading caches in the area. did not have this cache as well. It was who wanted to clear a previous DNF and I was all for clearing previous DNFs. He parked his vehicle close to ground zero and, when we got out, we saw we were within ten feet of ground zero. So, yes, we searched the area. I mainly questioned as to places he looked rather than searched myself. It was night, he had been here, so something may not have been right. After I had enough information, I began my search. The first order of business was to take the terrain rating into account. I have done some of the cache owners caches before and have a feel for how she might rate terrain. I also know well unfortunately that her GPSr and my GPSr dont quite agree. It was with this information I descended and began my search. During my search, I found a laptop case and a briefcase. I wonder what events could have transpired to have caused them to come to rest at this location? Five minutes later and fifty feet away, I spotted what could have only been the cache. I left it alone and called my other two teammates to the site and pointed to the hide. Once they saw, we each signed the log book in our own handwriting. Im currently dealing with an issue where I dont understand why people refuse to sign one of my log books with their own hands. That cache and this have a lot in common. And look my team didnt have a problem signing the book. Perhaps theres another reason?'

  - 'Found cache while caching in the area wih friends. Thanks for the cache. Roger'
  - 'The updated coords work better. Terrain rating helped also. Thanks for the hunt!'
  - 'I used the coordinates of a previous cacher to find this one. The posted coordinates are great for parking, but dont fit the difficulty or terrain rating which are correct . Great camo job! I think I looked right at the cache twice before I saw it on the third time.'
  - 'What an interesting area once you start to roam. If its in there I will have to try another time. A little too damp to be roaming the hill.'

  - 'That was even more difficult than I had expected. and I were out this morning on an FTF sweep and we came here on our stop. I didnt have my GPS out much after we left the car, due to the terrain and me not wanting to injure myself, but I believe that the coordinates are just a hair over off. Id chalk it up to bad reception in the cache area, personally. Speaking of bad reception I checked in there, too. Turned out that we had both looked right at the cache spot and not checked it throughly enough. I ended up going back and put my hands on it first! So I took home the lovely FTF necklace my caching widow wife will like that, I expect. Thanks for the challenge!'

  - 'Two very happy children found their first geocache. The clues, and comments got us there as we had no GPS.'
  - 'Took us a wee while to locate the path but once we found it, Mummy Cider Drinker found it with ease... because Pink Floyd is her favourite ; TFTC xxxx'
  - 'we found this one in the dark, co rds were spot on. TFTC'
  - 'Short walk and a quick find TFTC TNLN'
  - 'Found by Turnstones. We too walked all the way around the village and came in from the North then realised as we continued back to the church that what we had ignored as we thought it was a private driveway was also the correct footpath access point. A very well hidden cache but the GPS was spot on in this case. TNLN. TFTC.'
  - 'Need to go away and think about this. Glad others have had mixed results. Luckily we had an OS map which helped find the track. Will go back in the winter. The gps was not very cooperative with the tree cover.. Our knowledge of part of the hint is shaky too.'
  - 'It wasnt clear on the map where the footpath started, so I tried to access it from the churchyard but that was wrong. I couldnt see any signs, so walked right round the village and accessed the path from the north. Then I couldnt find the cache. I gave up after a short search as there were several muggles in the car park of the house and the GPSr was pointing towards the car park. For future the cachers, the footpath starts as the drive to some houses and isnt signposted until you reach the cache site.'
  - 'Another quick find after decyrpting the clue. Shame about the selfish nitwit who decided his vehicle warranted all thee parking spaces outside the church. TFTC'
  - 'Found the track ok but not the cache.'
  - 'Found on a morning caching with Sarah. Hot day! tftc'
  - 'always disapointing to start the day with a DNF but after of an hour searching along both side down to the clearing, I was none the wiser with the hint. worst part is others saying easy find, guess my floyd tune must have been darkside of the moon'
  - 'Parked in the village the heat was getting too much now, at least it was in the shade for searching, and it was an easy find in the end. I must have just missed the Paws an Us cachers according to the log. TNLN Signed the log at Thanks for the cache'
  - 'Once we had found the way to the bridleway it was an easy find despite the clue! TFTC'
  - 'No problem once we had found the start of the track!Helpful local put us in the right place. TFTC'
  - 'Well I dont like logging a DNF for a cache so young but following a very quick visit yesterday we were already late home by the time we arrived! we came back fresh this morning. Lots of searching, a couple of stung legs and brambled hands and we still couldnt find it . As per previous cacher GPS took us to the footpath sign but hunt as we did we just failed to find it today. Good luck to the next person... We shall be back...'
  - 'FTF! Found after a short search GPS suggested it was at the start of the path, but had to go along it a bit. Eventually found it & was very pleased to see a blank log! TFTC'

  - 'went out for the cache, bridge still out but lots of places to cross. tftc great quick pick thanks.'
  - 'Got out of the house with Soupy and Toothfairy. Took the walk with no bridge to get us to the spot. Totally amazed at the Elmer Fudd logging operation that has occured here. Sherry pointed out that in the old days that the manson that was at this location had several gardener buildings and that most of this area was a lush lawns and numerous varied species of trees, Coming in I remember that in high school we drove thru the area and looked for girls of course . I do remember the lush lawns and a wonderful spot. Today I feel that no justice has been shown to our forefathers. Took the coin that was not listed in the cache and left a dollar! TFTC and I look forward to your return home! Wildfire and Toothfairy'

  - 'This was my first nighttime find as well as my first find in Montana! Got to this one from the road instead of trail in park, so had to do the river crossing and brush whacking by moonlight! No way we could have done that if there was foliage on the deciduous trees! SL, TNLN. TFTH, fun times!'

Mrs. Geoboater hung out at the park while the invincible Mr. Geoboater romped across a log over the stream creek river to get to the other side. Someone on this team has to show sound judgement when it comes to taking or leaving a cache. TNL band aid dispenser, SL'

  - 'I have been trying to come up with some kind of witty words to add here but they seem to have slipped away like the foam on a mug of beer. The search was fun and the hide was not hard, seems to me I have found a cache around here before. They have really thinned things in here. It will be great and a couple of years as things get growing again. Thanks for the fun and the smiley.'

  - 'I should have recognized the warning signs. Now its too late. Now I can not stop! Tks! for the cache & the geocache poetry!. Left a polished stone.'
  - 'How many times have I tripped down this trail in the dark, arm in arm with some beloved friend or family member often both? How many times have I tripped over tree roots, stifling a giggle as I hear a not so distant dog barking at our absolute failure at furtiveness? How many times have I kicked myself, despite my many visits, for bringing a hopelessly inadequate flashlight for the task at hand? How many times have I had a fabulous time traipsing through the woods after an event to rediscover the final stage of this caches predecessor? The answer on all accounts is, countless. Thanks for all the memories, and thanks for showing us what this spot looks like in the daylight! TFTC, tnln. Leonata'

  - 'How you elude me, seductive vixen, Calling upon Mother Nature to blanket my path With crisp snow, and under; diabolical ice. You sing to me, A siren in the woods, Enticing me to seek your treasures. I, unable to clear my muddled brain, Answer to you and your minions. Ever questing for the glories you promise. I have reached you, this time, Enchantress, and yet, I still seek, still hear, still thirst for Your next chorus. Thanks for the cache, Jen and Dean! And thanks for taking me on so many of your travels in search of adventures in Geocaching! Hope this helps my Karma!'
  - 'It was nice to come home from a week trip to find some new caches. Boy, the city sure made a mess of this area! Quick find on a great, sunny Saturday morning! Too much of a head cold and cold drugs have eliminated any possibility of originality for log writing this morning, so Ill just have to hope for good karma! TNLNSL, TFTC!'
