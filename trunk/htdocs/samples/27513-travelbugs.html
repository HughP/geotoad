Gobold Park and Sk8-Cary skate park. This geocache will be an easy hike for geocachers who are bringing along their small children (like I always do!) The trail is possibly not suitable for all strollers but the hike is short and a stroller may not be necessary. Park your car in the parking lot near the tennis courts/playground. You could also park near the skate park, which has an adjoining parking lot, and get to it from there. The playground is small but still a nice diversion for the kids after finding their treasure. They may also enjoy watching the big kids skating at the skate park, if you go when it is open.<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
The container is a clear/white rubbermaid container, approximately 10 inches by 6 inches. It is clearly labeled with a green geocache sticker on it.<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
There are several items in it that would appeal to kids (and maybe some adults). This geocache was actually a birthday present for my son, 4, for whom it is named. He picked the location himself and can't wait to see what people will bring to his "treasure box"!</p>

Geocache location: Bond Park, Cary, North Carolina. <br>&nbsp;
 Placed by <br>&nbsp;

This was my first attempt at placing a geocache. I wanted this location to be very accessible in order to encourage as many visitors as possible. It was a challenge finding such a place within the Cary town limits. If walking is not your thing, park either at the boat ramp or in the Bond Park Community Center parking lot. Stick to trails and paths until you get very close. 9-23-2001; the original cache container (remember the plastic bear?) served well for over half a year but in the end suffered from wear. I have replaced it with a larger more sturdy box. As always, tread lightly and use caution when venturing into nature. We are just visitors, it's the creatures that live here..</p>

<font color="#555555"><strong>Glenn &amp; Scott</strong></font>, N35 46.022 W078 43.361<br><font color="#339933">Traditional Cache D2.5/T2.0 Distance: 4.8mi SE<br>placed: 16apr01 last: 12 days ago</font><br><p>Cache location - Lake Johnson Park in Raleigh, NC This cache is located in Lake Johnson Park which is just south of Raleigh. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 The original cache site "Lake Johnson Boaters geocache #1" was not accessible by boat. Rather than risk damage from heavy foot traffic to the delicate ecosystem of the lake's upstream marsh / swamp, Scott and I decided to move the cache to a new more accessible location. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 There are two ways to access this cache. By boat (preferred), you will want to park at the boathouse off of Avent Ferry Road. Rent a CANOE! and start hunting. Paddleboats draw too much water for this shallow part of the lake, you will get stuck, trust me :P <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 By foot, you can reach the cache off of the trail running around the perimeter of the lake. The closest foot-access parking area is at the office building near the corner of Jones Franklin Rd. & I-440. <br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
 When planted this cache contained: 
 <br>&nbsp;
 (o) 1 $15 gift card to Best Buy. 
 <br>&nbsp;
 (o) some bouncy balls 
 <br>&nbsp;
 (o) candy 
 <br>&nbsp;
 (o) a Carolina Hurricanes hat 
 <br>&nbsp;
 (o) a beanie baby 
 <br>&nbsp;
 (o) a humuorous magazine clipping 
 <br>&nbsp;
 (o) logbook & pens </p>
