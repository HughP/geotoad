Questions and Answers:
----------------------

1. How do you enable friendly waypoint id names?

    The synthesized waypoint id's are a feature named EasyName. Set
    your maximum EasyName waypoint length (16 for Garmin), and it will
    use them.


2. Geocaching Swiss Army Knife complains about the GPX format. How do I
   make them compatible?

    Don't use EasyName waypoints.


3. What software can you use the GPX files in?

    Here are a few software products I have found that make use of GPX 
    files. If you have any to add, please e-mail thomas%stromberg.org

4. Why is there no GUI for GeoToad?

    Because we haven't gotten to it yet. There have been some
    failed projects by 3rd party users to produce one, and we are
    looking for developers to give us this capability in 4.0.

5. What are the "Fun Factor" ratings?

    Fun Factor is a 'synthesized' rating that is generated by 
    parsing the geocache comments with a spam filtering engine that
    has been taught what an exciting geocache is or a dull geocache.
    
    If you would like to tune or calibrate this rating system, take 
    a look at the files in tools/ to add new caches to your preference
    database (data/). No documentation is available for these tools
    at this time.
    
6. geotoad.exe gets relative paths wrong in Windows

This only affects users of the command-line, rather than the text user
interface.

GeoToad for Windows is packaged by tar2rubyscript and rubyscript2exe,
which seems to forget the current working directory. Because of this,
if you are using a relative path, it will default to the directory
that GeoToad is installed to, rather than the working directory it
was launched from.
